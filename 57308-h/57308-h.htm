<h2 id="ACKNOWLEDGMENTS">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p>This book owes much to many: to the Trustees of the
American Academy in Rome, the John Simon Guggenheim
Memorial Foundation, and the Research Committee
of the University of Wisconsin Graduate School, for giving
me the opportunity to spend three years in Italy; to Laurance
and Isabel Roberts, for hospitality and moral support; to
Axel Boëthius, for friendship and instruction; to Ernest
Nash, for photographs and advice; to Mrs. Inez Longobardi,
the best and most helpful of librarians and friends;
to Ferdinando Castagnoli, for sharing with me his incomparable
knowledge of the topography of Rome and Latium;
to R. I. W. Westgate and Alston Chase, who taught me Latin
at Harvard and have been my friends for thirty years; to
the staff of the St. Martin’s Press: Diane Wheeler-Nicholson,
and Fred J. Royar, for giving the book so handsome a dress;
especially to my colleague J. P. Heironimus, for meticulous
proofreading which saved me from much error; and to
Frank E. Brown, who introduced me to archaeology and
is hereby absolved from responsibility for all untoward
results of the introduction. My overarching debt is acknowledged
in the dedication.</p>

<span class="subhead">Prehistoric Italy</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In May of 1945 two young British Army officers, John Bradford
and Peter Williams-Hunt, based with the R.A.F. at
Foggia in the province of Puglia, near the heel of Italy,
found that the World War II armistice left them with time
on their hands. Both trained archaeologists, they readily prevailed
upon the R.A.F. to combine routine training flights
with pushing back the frontiers of science. The result of
their air reconnaissance was to change profoundly the
archaeological map of Italy.</p>

<p>The value of air-photography for archaeology had long
been known; as early as 1909 pictures taken from a balloon
had revealed the plan of Ostia, the port of ancient Rome.
But the English, especially such pioneers as Major G. W. G.
Allen and O. G. S. Crawford, early took the lead in interpreting,
on photographs taken usually for military purposes,
vegetation-marks showing the presence and plan of ancient
sites buried beneath the soil, and invisible to the groundling’s
eye. Where the subsoil has been disturbed in antiquity
by the digging of a ditch, the increased depth of soil will
produce more luxuriant crops or weeds; where soil-depth
is decreased by the presence of ancient foundations, walls,
floors, or roads, the crop will be thin, stunted, lighter in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
color. Air-photographs taken in raking light, just after sunrise
or just before sunset in a dry season, especially over
grassland, will highlight these buried landscapes. The Tavoliere,
the great prairie where Foggia lies, thirty by fifty-five
miles in extent, suits these conditions admirably; its mean
annual rainfall is only 18.6 inches (0.6 in July) or half that
of Rome, and Rome is a dry place, at least in summer.
So Bradford and Williams-Hunt had high hopes for their
project.</p>

<p>In a Fairchild high-wing monoplane, in which the position
of struts and nacelles does not interfere with the operation
of a hand-held camera, they took oblique shots at
1,000 feet with an air camera of 8-inch focal length. For
vertical shots they used, at 10,000 feet, air cameras of 20-inch
focal length, mounted tandem to produce overlap
for stereoscopic examination, which makes pictures three-dimensional.
The thousands of resulting photographs were
at a scale of about 1:6000, or ten inches to the mile, over
four times as large as the best available ground maps (the
1:25,000 series of the Italian Istituto Geografico Militare.)</p>

<p>Bradford, realizing the archaeological value of the millions
of air-photographs taken during the war by the British
and American Strategic Air Commands, prevailed upon
the authorities to deposit prints, giving complete coverage
for Italy, in Rome (with the British and Swedish Schools)
and the American Academy. The initiative of Prof. Kirk
H. Stone procured a similar set for the University of Wisconsin.
The stereoscopic study of these collections will
mean great strides in Italian archaeology. The accuracy
of the data obtained is amazing: ditches estimated from
the photographs with a good micrometer scale to be four
feet wide proved when measured on the ground to be
precisely that.</p>

<p>What the photographs revealed, scattered over the 1650
square miles of the Tavoliere, were over 2000 settlements,
some up to 800 yards across, surrounded by one to eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
ditches. Within the ditched area, and approached by in-turned,
tunnel-shaped entrances, were smaller, circular
patches, which looked like hut-enclosures, or “compounds.”
Three examples of the sites photographed will illustrate
typical settlements. At a site identified on the map (<a href="#ip_1_1">Fig. 1.1</a>)
as San Fuoco d’Angelone, eight miles northeast of
Foggia, the photographs showed a ditch-enclosed oval measuring
500 × 400 feet, and an inner circle 260 feet across,
with what proved to be the characteristic funnel-shaped
opening. At Masseria Fongo, four miles south of Foggia,
the oval was estimated at 480 yards long, with a 12-foot
entrance and 12-foot ditches. At Passo di Corvo (<a href="#ip_1_2">Fig. 1.2</a>),
eight miles northeast of Foggia, the enclosure measured
800 × 500 yards, and the details were revealed by masses
of flowers, yellow wild cabbage, mauve wild mint, white
cow-parsley.</p>

<p>So much for results from the study of photographs. The
next step for Bradford was to spend a fruitful season in
the study. Archaeology is a comparative science: to know
one site is to know nothing; to know a thousand is to see
some factors unifying all. Thus the settlement-shapes of
the Tavoliere are reminiscent of the fortified stronghold
of Dimini in Thessaly (<a href="#ip_1_3">Fig. 1.3</a>), dated by its excavation
in the late neolithic age, which in Greece means about
2650 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> They also look like the fortified site of Altheim
near Munich (<a href="#ip_1_4">Fig. 1.4</a>), also late neolithic, which in Germany
means about 1900 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Culture in Europe moved
from east to west; in general the farther west the site, the
later it reached its successive levels of culture. The Tavoliere
sites, lying geographically between Dimini and Altheim,
might well be intermediate in date also; by their
shape, at any rate, they are almost certainly to be dated
sometime in the neolithic period. So much can be guessed
before the indispensable next step is taken. The next step
is excavation.</p>

Modern archaeological excavation is neither haphazard
nor a treasure hunt. It is a scientific business, preceded
by careful survey, conducted with minute attention to
levels and strata (the level in which an object is found
determines its relative date; comparison with similar objects
found elsewhere that can be dated determines its absolute
date), and followed by scrupulous recording and publication
of the evidence. A dig is not a treasure hunt. Naturally
an archaeologist is pleased if he turns up gold or precious
stones, but he knows in advance that an old stone age
site will produce neither, but rather something infinitely
more valuable, an intimate knowledge of man’s past, gained
from ordinary humble objects of daily household use. To
find these was Bradford’s object when he began to dig.
(Williams-Hunt had meanwhile been posted to the Far
East.) And he found them. Passo di Corvo, for example,
yielded typical neolithic artifacts: stone axes, querns (hand-mills
for grinding grain), bone points, stone sickles, pendants,
spindle-whorls, and, best of all, vast quantities of
potsherds, over 4,000 found in fourteen days. The potsherd
is the archaeologist’s best friend. Pots are virtually indestructible,
they turn up everywhere, and comparison with
pots of similar shape and decoration, found elsewhere, yields
precious information about dates, imports, exports, trade-routes,
and the aesthetic taste of the pot’s maker and user.</p>

<p>S. Fuoco d’Angelone, for example, yielded typical neolithic
pottery: rich brown or glossy black burnished ware,
undecorated but thin-walled, symmetrical, and well-made
(by hand, not on a potter’s wheel; sooner or later the use
of the wheel produces shoddy commercialism). Together
with it were found sherds of a fine-textured buff ware,
painted with wide bands (<i>fasce larghe</i>) of tomato red. There
were also very thin burnished bowls in cream and gray.</p>

<p>After excavation, the archaeologist must return to the
study and to the comparative method; an exacting and exciting
pursuit of parallels, especially for the pottery, in the
hope of dating it and tracking down its origins. The facts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
are recorded in technical excavation reports, often buried
in obscure or local journals. Oftener, the results of excavation
are unpublished (it is always more fun to dig than
to write.) In that case, the facts are treasured up in the
notes or the memories of the excavator, often a local archaeologist.
He belongs to a splendid breed, burning with
enthusiasm, brimful of knowledge, and eager to share what
he knows, in conversation if not in print.</p>

<p>So Bradford read and talked, and found his parallels.
The wares he had excavated were familiar; they had been
found elsewhere in the heel of Italy, especially opposite
or in Matera, in Lucania, and Molfetta, in Puglia, between
Barletta and Bari, in contexts dated 2600–2500 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> And this
pottery proves to have affinities, too, with that of Thessalian
Sesklo, a neolithic site not far from Dimini. This same
type of pottery can be traced across the Balkans into Illyricum,
and thence across the Adriatic to Bradford’s sites,
giving in the process a glimpse of neolithic man as a more
daring seafarer than had previously been thought.</p>

<p>And so, by patient, detailed work like Bradford’s, the
newly-discovered sites are fitted into and enrich the pattern
of the neolithic world. The total mapping fills a huge gap
in the picture of the findspots of Neolithic sites in Italy.
Before 1945, some 170 were known; now the Tavoliere alone
makes up more than that number. And Passo di Corvo becomes
the largest known neolithic site in Europe.</p>

<p>The things the archaeologists did not find are instructive,
too. No weapons were found: the inference is that the
Tavoliere folk were unwarlike. There is no evidence that
the sites survived into the Bronze Age: it looks as though,
like unwarlike peoples all too often elsewhere, they were
wiped out in an invasion.</p>

<p>It is clear from the artifacts and the site-plans that neolithic
man on the Tavoliere lived like neolithic man elsewhere
in Italy, that the culture was on the whole uniform.
He lived in a wattle-and-daub hut with a sunken floor, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
central hearth, and a smokehole—the remote and primitive
predecessor of the atrium-and-impluvium house of historic
Roman times, whose central apartment had a hole in the
roof with a pool below to catch rain water. Fortunately for
us, his wife was a slovenly housekeeper: from her rubbish
we can reconstruct her way of life. In his enclosures he
penned the animals he had domesticated: other Italian sites
have yielded the bones of the sheep, goat, horse, ox, ass,
and pig. The dog has not yet become man’s best friend in
the neolithic Tavoliere. Primitive man in Italy had a rudimentary
religion: the Ligurian cave of Arene Candide has
yielded statuettes of big-breasted, pregnant women, which
probably had something to do with a fertility cult. In another
Ligurian cave, Balzi Rossi, over 200,000 stone implements
have been found. Not far up the Adriatic coast from
Foggia, in the Vibrata valley, lie the foundations of 336
neolithic huts. We know something, too, of neolithic man’s
burial customs, and macabre enough they seem: skulls have
been found smeared with red ochre; apparently the flesh
was stripped from the corpse—a practice called in Italian
<i>scarnitura</i>—and the stain applied to the bared bone. All
this suggests a level of culture far below that which the
Near East was enjoying at the same time: Passo di Corvo’s
mud huts are contemporary with the Great Pyramid of
Egypt, with palaces and temples in Mesopotamia (see <a href="#ip_1_5">Fig. 1.5</a>).
But there is no evidence that neolithic man in Italy
was priest-ridden or tyrannized over, as the Egyptians and
Akkadians were; he is rather to be thought of as the ancestor
of the sturdy peasant stock which was to form the backbone
of Roman Italy.</p>

<p>Bradford’s methods are scientific, but archaeology has not
always been the exact science it is today. Americans may
be proud that the first recorded scientific excavation took
place in Indian mounds in Virginia. The date was 1784, and
the excavator was Thomas Jefferson. But thereafter archaeological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
progress was sporadic, and relapse accompanied advance.
In the mid-nineteenth century most excavations in
Italy were more like rape than science, their aim being to
dredge up treasures for the nobility and the art-dealers.</p>

<p>Thus when in 1889 the distinguished Italian anthropologist
Luigi Pigorini excavated the site of Castellazzo di Fontanellato,
twelve miles northwest of Parma, in the Po Valley,
there was no absolute guarantee that the dig would be
scientific. Yet Pigorini’s announced results have colored the
whole picture of the Bronze Age in Italy, and it is only
recently that they have been doubted. The story of his
announced results, the growing scepticism, the re-examination
of the ground, and the present state of the question
is an illuminating if sobering one.</p>

<p>What Pigorini was after was the evidence for the prehistoric
settlements which have come to be called <i>terremare</i>.
They owe their discovery, their name, and their destruction
to the fertilizing quality of the earth of which they are
composed. <i>Terra marna</i> is the name in the dialect of Emilia
for the compost heaps formed by the decay of organic matter
in certain mounds of ancient date, mostly south of the
Po. Farmers repeatedly found potsherds and other artifacts,
often of bronze, in these mounds, and Pigorini determined
to examine them before all the evidence should be dispersed.
Castellazzo di Fontanellato is the most famous of
his efforts.</p>

<p>He found clear, though meager, evidence in pottery and
metal artifacts (axes, daggers, pins, razors) of a Bronze
Age culture, but no report of the levels in which he found
these objects survives, and indeed in this as in most <i>terremare</i>
the farmer’s shovel has completely upset the levels.
Roman terracotta, medieval pottery, and prehistoric bronze
axe-heads jostle one another in confusion. Besides, the prehistoric
site has been continuously inhabited, and, in consequence,
the soil continuously turned over, ever since
Roman times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
Pigorini apparently dug isolated, random trenches rather
than the continuous ones which would have enabled him
to trace a ground-plan securely. It is hard to see, without
more evidence than he supplies, how the grandiose grid of
his ultimate plan (<a href="#ip_1_6">Fig. 1.6</a>) could be deduced from the
disconnected series of trenches figured on his earliest one.
Though he had to contend with the most vexatious swampy
conditions, working in the midst of constant seepage and
ubiquitous mud, in which a rectangular grid could hardly
have survived, he was nevertheless able to persuade himself,
at Castellazzo, of the existence of a ditch and a rampart,
reinforced by wooden piling. (Post-holes and piles he certainly
found, and photographed.)</p>

<p>By 1892 he had convinced himself that his site had a
trapezoidal plan, surrounded by a ramparted ditch thirty
yards wide and ten feet deep. (Some of his dimensions suggest
a prehistoric unit of measure in multiples of five; others
a foreshadowing of the Roman foot of twenty-nine centimeters.)
Running water derived from a tributary of the Po
supplied the hypothetical ditch, which was crossed on the
south by a wooden drawbridge thirty yards wide and sixty
yards long. South of the site Pigorini claimed to have found
a cemetery (M) perfectly square in plan, for cremation
urn-burials, and westward another, rectangular one.</p>

<p>In 1893 he announced the discovery, within the rampart,
halfway along its east side, of a mound in a reserved area
or <i>templum</i> (G), surrounded by its own ditch; in 1894 this
<i>templum</i> became the <i>arx</i>, or citadel of the settlement, having
in its midst a sacrificial trench (<i>mundus</i>) containing
in its floor, for the deposit of the sacrificial fruits, five sinkholes
each equipped with a wooden cover.</p>

(D. Randall-MacIver, <i>Italy before the Romans</i>, p. 45)</p></div></div>

<p>In 1895 and 1896 he published claims to have found
within the rampart a grid of streets (<i>cardines</i> and <i>decumani</i>),
which he held to be the ancestor of the grid in
Roman camps and Roman colonies. The total plan was
alleged to resemble that of primitive Rome (Roma Quadrata),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
and the wooden bridge was compared to Rome’s
early wooden one across the Tiber, the Pons Sublicius. At
another site one of Pigorini’s pupils claimed to have found
traces of a ritual furrow like that with which hundreds of
years later the Romans were to mark the line of the future
walls of a colony. For Pigorini and his school regarded the
<i>terremare</i> folk as the ancestors of an Iron Age people called
Villanovans, and ultimately of the Romans of historical
times.</p>

<p>Since Pigorini’s death in 1920 other archaeologists have
been moved to go over the ground again, revising his findings
and his inferences. Having excogitated his grid plan
for Castellazzo di Fontanellato, Pigorini seems to have generalized
from it rather more widely than the evidence warranted.
While rectangular or square plans are not denied
for some <i>terremare</i> (modern investigators enumerate ten),
many sites are oval, not unlike Bradford’s Tavoliere hut-settlements.
In fact the <i>terremare</i> plan varies more than
Pigorini was willing to admit. Furthermore, parallel in date
to the <i>terremare</i> are unmoated hut villages and true lake
dwellings. (The <i>terremare</i> are lake dwellings without the
lake, presumably a reminiscence in the minds of immigrants
from beyond the Alps of their primordial homes.)</p>

<p>But while we must grant to his critics that Pigorini had,
to say the least, a strong imagination, we need not go so
far as one of his detractors who argued that the <i>terremare</i>
are Bronze Age pigsties. One site has an area of thirty-five
acres, which is a bit large for a pigsty.</p>

<p>The <i>terremare</i> are important: they preserve the memory
of an immigrant population, distinct in culture from the
aborigines. The distinguishing marks of this new culture
are knowledge of metal-working, a pottery identifiable by
its exaggerated half-moon handles, and the practice of cremation
rather than inhumation. On the evidence, we must
suppose that this new culture emerged about 1500 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> as
a fusion of indigenous hut-dwellers and immigrant lakedwellers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Bronze bits found in their settlements show that
they had domesticated the horse, and there is some evidence,
outside the <i>terremare</i>, for dogs as well, described
by Randall-MacIver as “doubtless good woolly animals of
a fair size.”</p>

<p>In fact the Bronze Age in Italy of which the <i>terremare</i>
are a part represents a considerable cultural development
beyond the level of the Neolithic Tavoliere folk. Cave dwellings
from Liguria show a people using wagons and ox-drawn
plows. Chemical analysis of their copper shows that some
of it comes from central Germany, though a copper ingot
from Sardinia betrays by its impressed double-ax trade-mark
some connection with Minoan Crete. (The <i>terremare</i> are
contemporary with Mycenae.) Bronze Age women wore
jewelry: jadeite arm rings, necklaces of pierced red coral,
bored stones, or clamshells. Curious stamps called <i>pintaderas</i>
were used to impress a pattern in color on the body. A
horned mannikin, with penis erect, from Campo di Servirola,
now in the museum of Reggio Emilia, may be evidence for
fertility cult, like the neolithic female idols from the Ligurian
caves.</p>

<p>The Po valley in the Bronze Age was a melting pot in
which a variety of cultures, indigenous and immigrant,
mingled. What is to be read from the excavations is almost
a recapitulation in this early period, in terms of creative
imitation of imported and native forms and ideas, of the
whole cultural history of Rome. To our knowledge of this
culture, and to our appreciation of the importance of scrupulous
archaeological recording, the curious story of Pigorini’s
<i>terremare</i> contributed not a little.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The island of Sardinia to the archaeologist is a fascinating
curiosity, isolated, until recently, by its unhealthy climate
and its odd dialect. In prehistoric times, however, while
Sardinia’s development does not parallel that of the mainland,
its level of culture appears from archaeological finds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and monuments to have been higher, not lower, than that
of Italy proper. This superior level seems to have been due
to Sardinia’s richness in metals. To protect the wealth, the
prehistoric islanders built enormous watchtowers, called
<i>nuraghi</i>, which developed into veritable feudal castles with
villages nestling at their feet.</p>

<p>Recent excavations (1951–56) by Professor Giovanni
Lilliu of the University of Cagliari have cast clearer light
on Sardinia’s culture. He excavated the huge <i>nuraghe</i> of
Su Nuraxi, at Barumini, some thirty miles north of Cagliari.
When he began, Su Nuraxi was a small hill covered with
ruins, earth, and scrub. Now six campaigns have revealed
a truncated conical tower (<a href="#ip_1_7">Fig. 1.7</a>), built, without mortar,
of huge many-sided blocks of basalt. Clustered above the
tower he found a small Village; the whole complex—tower
plus the village—is surrounded by other <i>nuraghi</i> on neighboring
hills. To the original single tower four others, with
upper courses of dressed stone, were added in a clover-leaf
pattern, linked by a curtain-wall enclosing a court sixty
feet deep, with a reservoir fifteen feet deep for drinking
water. The central tower is three stories high, with a corbelled
or false-vaulted roof built of gradually converging
horizontal courses. The upper stories were reached by a
spiral stair in the thickness of the wall. Lilliu meticulously
observed stratigraphy; for dating, he submitted samples of
carbonized matter from the towers to laboratories in Milan,
and was told that the Carbon 14 process dates his remains
as 1270 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> ± 200 years.</p>

<p>The C<sup>14</sup> method of dating, an American device discovered
and perfected by Professor W. F. Libby and his associates
at the University of Chicago Institute of Nuclear Studies,
is sufficiently new to deserve a word of explanation here.
All living matter has a uniform radioactivity associated with
its carbon content. The supply of the radioactive isotope
C<sup>14</sup> ceases when living matter, wood, foliage, etc., dies.
Scientists can calculate the time elapsed since death by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
counting the residual radioactivity of C<sup>14</sup> in the organic
specimen, since the rate of decay can be described by specifying
how long it takes for half the number of atoms in a
given sample to disintegrate. For C<sup>14</sup> this period, called its
“half-life,” is 5700 years. If the present assay of a specimen
of organic matter, for instance, is 12.5 C<sup>14</sup> explosions per
minute per gram of carbon, an ancient organic sample
assaying at 6.25 would be 5700 years old (the half-life of
C<sup>14</sup>). Checking with samples of known date has proved the
method accurate within 200 years either way. For most
classical objects found in association with organic matter
this is valueless, since a trained archaeologist can date a
pot, an inscription, or an architectural block by eye within
fifty years or less. But the method is invaluable for making
more precise the great sweeps of time in prehistory. Thus
the lowest C<sup>14</sup> date for Su Nuraxi, 1070 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, would take it
almost into the Iron Age in Italy; at this date culture on
the mainland was much more primitive.</p>

<p>Lilliu calls the period of the four added towers Lower
Nuragic I, and dates it 800–750 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> These smaller towers
contain each a single cell with two rows of loopholes. They
are guard-posts, and are equipped with speaking-tubes for
the guards use when challenging.</p>

<p>In the next period, Upper Nuragic I, dated by Lilliu 750–500
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, the earth having subsided, the four towers and
the walls were reinforced. The ground-level entrance was
blocked, and replaced by a new entrance twenty-one feet
higher, accessible only by ladder. Battlements now replaced
the loopholes. Stone balls found in the excavations were
apparently the projectiles hurled from these battlements.
From a watchtower added to the central <i>nuraghe</i> come
conch shells, perhaps intended to be sounded like trumpets.</p>

<p>The surrounding village, of 200 or 300 huts, separated
by narrow labyrinthine passages, housed the troops; the
chief lived in the tower. The village, hard-hit when the
Carthaginians sacked it late in the sixth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, survived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
in decadence till the late first century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The typical
oval or rectangular plan of an early Su Nuraxi village hut
resembles that of the Bronze Age in Sicily or Cyprus. One
contained a pit for votive offerings. Sixty round huts, with
lower courses in stone, have been dated in Upper Nuragic I.
They would have been roofed, like shepherd huts in Sardinia
to this day, with logs and branches weighted by
stones. One larger circle has seats around its inner perimeter.
It was equipped with shelves, a niche, a stone basin, and
a sacred stone (a model of a <i>nuraghe</i>). Lilliu thinks this
must have been the warriors’ council chamber.</p>

<p>Su Nuraxi yielded artifacts in stone, terracotta, bronze,
iron, lead, and amber, the latter showing connections with
trade routes to the Baltic. Lilliu found axes, millstones,
pestles, and bronze votive statuettes. Pottery and <i>fibulae</i>
(humble safety-pins, whose shapes, varying from age to
age, are a help in dating) suggest connections with Phoenicia—via
Carthage—and Etruria, whose rich and, in certain
respects, mysterious culture is discussed in the next
chapter.</p>

<p>In a later phase, after the Carthaginian invasion, the huts
have fan-shaped rooms, each devoted to a specialized occupation,
baking, oil-pressing, stone-tool making. A pair of
stone boot-trees, or shoe-lasts, presumably from a cobbler’s
shop, was one of the more curious finds. Gewgaws in glass
paste, poor, decadent, commercialized, but traditional in
design, testify to the material and aesthetic poverty of this
period. Only the last phase yielded tombs, but a huge stele
with a curved top may have marked the entrance to what
the peasants call a Giant’s Grave, a Stone Age slab-edged
tomb, forming a corridor sometimes as much as twenty
yards along, from which two wings branch off to form a
semicircular approach.</p>

<p>This scientific dig provides a fixed foundation for future
research into earlier ages on Sardinia. Lilliu is understandably
excited about the “dynamic spirit” revealed by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
creators of this amazingly early massiveness, but like all
massiveness, whether of pyramid, ziggurat, or Roman Imperial
palace, it undoubtedly justifies the unhappy inference
that with all this grandeur went autocracy.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Perhaps the mainland political system in the early Iron
Age was less rigid; at any rate it can boast no architectural
remains as sophisticated as the Sardinian <i>nuraghi</i>. But the
artifacts, especially from graves, are more numerous than
for the Bronze or Neolithic Ages, and the graves show that
roughly speaking the peninsula was divided in the early
Iron Age between two cultures (<a href="#ip_1_8">Fig. 1.8</a>): the folk west
of a line drawn from Rome to Bimini cremated their dead;
those east of that line inhumed them. In and near Rome
the two burial rites are mingled: the significant inference
from this fact will be explained later. Because the finds are
so much more numerous on the mainland, the resulting
inferences involve a much more complex subdivision into
cultures and periods. We may single out three sets of inferences,
based primarily on three major archaeological efforts.
The first is Pericle Ducati’s work at Bologna, which
distinguished four cultural phases, named from Villanova,
the village where a major cemetery was found, and from
the Benacci and Arnoaldi estates, whence key finds come.
The second centers at Este, near Padua, famous for its
bronze <i>situle</i> or buckets finely decorated by punching from
the back, in the technique called <i>repoussé</i>. The third is
Paolo Orsi’s exemplary work in Sicily and South Italy. The
complex chronology is best set out in a tabular view (see
facing page).</p>

The cremation cemetery excavated as early as 1853 at
Villanova, near Bologna, produced artifacts (ossuary urns,
<i>fibulae</i>, razors, hairpins, distaffs, bracelets, fish hooks, tweezers,
<i>repoussé</i> bronze belts [see <a href="#ip_1_9">Fig. 1.9</a>]) which match
objects found later at other sites farther south, in Latium
and Etruria; e.g., the village in the process of excavation
since 1955 at San Giovenale, near Bieda, by H. M. King
Gustav VI of Sweden. Thus the inference is warranted
that this whole area was inhabited in the early Iron
Age by a people unified in culture. Since the Villanovans,
unlike the aborigines, cremated their dead, we infer that
they were foreigners, probably invaders; that they descended
from the <i>terremare</i> folk is not proven. That they
lived in wattle-and-daub huts roofed with carved beams
is inferred from the hut-urns (<a href="#ip_1_10">Fig. 1.10</a>) in which the Southern
Villanovans (in Rome and Latium) placed the ashes of
their dead. Though these huts show no great advance over
those of the Tavoliere or <i>terremare folk</i>, the people who
lived in them were skilled artisans, producing fine bronze
work. The finest example, from the late Arnoaldi period in
Bologna (<i>ca.</i> 525 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), is the Certosa <i>situla</i> (<a href="#ip_1_11">Fig. 1.11</a>),
where the scenes portrayed are so vivid that even a funeral
comes to life. In one band is a vignette of rustic festival,
where a slave drags a pig by the hind leg, a piper plays,
and the lord of the manor ladles his wine while he waits
for a dinner of venison. The deer is being brought on a
pole by two slaves, while a curly-tailed dog marches beneath.</p>

<p>Three other areas of Iron Age digs are worthy of mention.
One is Este, whose culture in general resembles Bologna’s,
with fine bronze buckets, belts, and pendants. A second is
Golasecca, near Lago Maggiore, where, as at Como, the
finds reveal a people making a living as transport agents,
forwarding artifacts back and forth between the Transalpine
country, Etruria and the Balkans. The graves yield safety-pins,
bronze buckets, small jewelry of bronze, iron, amber
and glass, horse-bits, chariot-parts, helmets, spears, and
swords. A third is the territory of Picenum, on the central
Adriatic coast; here the tombs are filled (<a href="#ip_1_12">Fig. 1.12</a>) with
maces, greaves, breastplates, even chariots, as might be
expected from the ancestors of those thorns in Rome’s flesh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
the warlike Samnites. The unique Warrior of Capestrano
(<a href="#ip_1_13">Fig. 1.13</a>), found in Picenum, shows how remote Picene
culture was, about 500 <i>B.C.</i>, from the influences affecting
the rest of the peninsula.</p>

<p>Finally, a brief word about Sicily in prehistory. Recent
excavations of over 400 graves in the Lipari Islands, and
of a Siculan village near Leontini, whose huts have front
porches, and otherwise resemble those of Latium, has established
closer connections with the mainland than used to
be thought possible. But our main knowledge of Siculan
culture results from the earlier excavations of Paolo Orsi,
near Syracuse, and on either side of the toe of Italy, at Torre
Galli and Canale. These provided a model of archaeological
method. The following table, resulting from Orsi’s careful
observation of the strata in which pots of various fabrics
were found in his digs near Syracuse, and of the frequency
of their distribution within levels, shows how division into
archaeological periods is arrived at. The Geometric ware
(the latest) is characteristic of the period he called Siculan
III, contemporary with Villanovan of the eighth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>If the prehistoric folk who lived on the Tavoliere, in the
<i>terremare</i>, and around the <i>nuraghi</i>, if the later Villanovans
and Siculans have any reality for us, we owe our insights
into their culture to the patience, critical spirit, and intelligence
of Bradford, Pigorini’s critics, Lilliu, Ducati, Orsi,
and other archaeologists. Their work has pushed back the
frontiers of Italian history nearly two millennia, and revealed
to us how the energy and capacity for creative borrowing
of provincial Italians contributed to the ultimate
strength and coherence of the Roman state, or how the
Italians fought the Romans when they proved high-handed.
To Roman culture of historical times another great contribution
was made by the Etruscans.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Etruscans</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Between Tiber and Arno there flourished, while Rome was
still a collection of mud huts above the Tiber ford, a rich,
energetic, and mysterious people, the Etruscans, whose
civilization was to influence Rome profoundly. Their riches
have been known to the modern world ever since the systematic
looting of the fabulous wealth of their underground
tombs began, as early as 1489. Visitors to the Vatican and
Villa Giulia Museums in Rome, and, better still, the Archaeological
Museum in Florence, can marvel at the splendid
weapons, rich gold-work, and handsome vases with which
more or less scientific grave-robbers have enriched the collections
in the last hundred years. Travellers to Tarquinia,
on the Tuscan seaboard, can wonder at the strange, vivid
paintings and seemingly indecipherable inscriptions on the
walls of mysterious and intricate underground chambers.
Etruscan bronze-work inspired the sculptors of the Renaissance,
Etruscan tombs were drawn by the pen of the great
engraver Piranesi, Etruscan cities and cemeteries were described
by perhaps the most interesting author, certainly
the best stylist, who ever wrote on archaeology, the Englishman
George Dennis.</p>

<p>Dennis’ <i>Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria</i>, though its last<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
edition appeared in 1883, is still the best general introduction
to Etruscology. His achievement is the more remarkable
in the light of the conditions under which he worked:
execrable roads, worse lodging, and malaria stalking the
whole countryside. In his day Etruscan tombs were exploited
exclusively in the interest of the art dealers, with
methods utterly unscientific. Artifacts without commercial
value were ruthlessly destroyed: it is heart-rending to read
Dennis’ account of the rape of Vulci:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">“Our astonishment was only equalled by our indignation
when we saw the labourers dash [coarse pottery of unfigured
and ... unvarnished ware, and a variety of
small articles in black clay] to the ground as they drew
them forth, and crush them beneath their feet as things
‘cheaper than seaweed.’ In vain I pleaded to save some
from destruction; for though of no remarkable worth,
they were often of curious and elegant forms, and valuable
as relics of the olden time, not to be replaced; but
no, it was all <i>roba di schiocchezza</i>—‘foolish stuff’—the
[foreman] was inexorable; his orders were to destroy
immediately whatever was of no pecuniary value, and
he could not allow me to carry away one of these relics
which he so despised.”</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">Unfortunately, looting of this kind produced much of the
material in our museums, whose precise findspots (from
the German <i>Fundort</i>, the precise place where an archaeologically
significant object was found) are consequently
often not known. On the other hand scientific excavation,
when it came, in the mid-nineteenth century found still
some tombs unplundered.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of Etruscan civilization is almost entirely
a triumph of this modern scientific archaeology, since written
Etruscan, with no known affinities, is still largely undeciphered,
though scientific methods have made large strides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
possible. In the last three generations archaeologists have
attacked and in great measure solved the problem of the
origin of the Etruscans, the nature of their cities, their
political organization, their religious beliefs and practices,
the degree of originality in their creative arts, their life and
customs. The result is a composite picture of the greatest
people to dominate the Italian peninsula before the Romans.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>As to origins, the Etruscans might have been indigenous,
or come down over the Alps, or, as most of the ancients
believed, have come by sea from Asia Minor. The difference
of their burial customs and, probably, their language
from those of their neighbors makes it unlikely that their
ruling class was native like, for example, the Villanovans;
the archaeological evidence for their links with the North
is very late, and the Northern theory has tended to fall
along with the discrediting of Pigorini’s notions (based,
as we saw, on unwarranted reconstruction of the <i>terremare</i>)
about a single line of descent for Etruscan and Italic peoples.
There remains the theory of Near Eastern origin, first stated
in the fifth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> by the Greek historian Herodotus,
and recently (in the 1930’s) given some slight support by
Italian excavators’ discovery of an inscription dated about
600 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> on the island of Lemnos, off the coast of Asia Minor
opposite Troy. Though the Lemnian dialect is non-Indo-European,
and therefore, like Etruscan, cannot be read, its
archaic letters can be transliterated. Beginning with the
bottom center line (<a href="#ip_2_1">Fig. 2.1</a>), continuing with the line on
the far left, and reading <i>boustrophedon</i> (alternately from
right to left and from left to right, like an ox plowing), it
reads <i>evistho zeronaith zivai/ sialchveiz aviz/ maraz mav/
vanalasial zeronai morinail/ aker tavarzio/ holaiez naphoth
ziazi</i>. The resemblance to the alphabet and the art-forms
of the Aules Feluskes stele from Etruscan Vetulonia (<a href="#ip_2_2">Fig. 2.2</a>)
is obvious. The particular letter-form transcribed as
<i>th</i> occurs elsewhere only in Phrygia in Asia Minor. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
very words and word-endings of the Lemnian stele can
be found on Etruscan inscriptions. Thus the inscription
shows at the very least that on an island “geographically
intermediate between Asia Minor and Italy a language
very similar to Etruscan was employed by some persons.”
The ancient tradition localizing the original home of the
Etruscans somewhere in or near northwest Asia Minor receives
here some archaeological support.</p>

<p>But the important thing is not where they came from,
but how their culture was formed. The archaeological evidence
justifies the hypothesis that they were a small but
vigorous military aristocracy from the eastern Mediterranean,
established in central Italy, where they built, by
borrowing and merging, upon a structure created by the
Villanovans. A new approach, the analysis of bones from
Etruscan tombs to ascertain the blood types of their ancient
occupants, may, by comparison with the persistent blood
types of modern Tuscans, enable the archaeologist to determine
what proportion of the ancient population was
native and what intrusive.</p>

<p>Archaeology tells us, too, that Etruscan civilization is a
culture of cities. Ancient literary sources speak of a league
of twelve Etruscan places (<a href="#ip_2_3">Fig. 2.3</a>), most of which have
yielded important archaeological material: from Veii, the
great terracotta Apollo; at Cerveteri, Vetulonia, Orvieto,
and Perugia, the remarkable rock-cut tombs; at Tarquinia,
Vulci, and Chiusi, strikingly vivid tomb-paintings; at Bolsena,
Roselle, and Volterra, mighty fortification walls; at
Populonia, the slag-heaps from the iron works which made
Etruria prosperous. But the most interesting, and some of
the latest, evidence for Etruscan city-planning and fortifications
comes from three sites, two in the northern Etruscan
sphere of influence: Marzabotto on the River Reno, fifteen
miles south of Bologna; Spina, near one of the seven mouths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of the Po; and one in northern Etruria itself, Bolsena,
ancient Volsinii.</p>

<div id="ip_2_4" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img src="images/i_009b.jpg" width="700" height="580" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 2.4</span> Marzabotto: grid plan.
(J. B. Ward Perkins, “Early Roman Towns in Italy,” Fig. 5)</div></div>

<p>The first recorded excavations at Marzabotto date from
the 1860’s, but the ruins had been known since 1550. The
striking discovery at Marzabotto was that the site (dated
by pottery in its necropolis to the late sixth or early fifth
centuries <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) had a regular, oriented, rectangular grid of
streets (<a href="#ip_2_4">Fig. 2.4</a>), enclosing house-blocks (<i>insulae</i>) averaging
165 × 35 yards. The main north-south street, or <i>cardo</i>,
and the main east-west street, or <i>decumanus</i>, were each
over forty-eight feet wide, the minor streets one third as
broad. The streets were paved, as they were not in Rome
until 350 years later. Drains ran beneath all the streets
except the reserved area (the Romans were to call it the
<i>pomerium</i>) just inside the circuit-wall. The house-plans
resemble closely the fourth-century ones discovered in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
1930’s at Olynthus, on the Chalcidice Peninsula in Greece,
by an American expedition. The house-doors had locks and
keys. A number of the buildings were recognizable as shops,
with back rooms for living quarters.</p>

<p>Bearing in mind the sobering experience of Pigorini’s
unwarranted claims about a grid plan for the <i>terremare</i>, we
might be tempted to scepticism about Marzabotto, except
for two facts: Brizio, the excavator, himself expressed
doubts, as early as 1891, about Pigorini’s reconstruction;
furthermore, a re-examination of the site in 1953 confirmed
the authenticity of Brizio’s findings.</p>

<p>The city is dominated, on the high ground to the northwest,
by an <i>arx</i>, bearing the footings, some of considerable
size with impressive moldings, of five structures, temples
or altars. One of them, facing south, and divided at the
back into three <i>cellae</i>, is the prototype of the Roman Capitolium,
decorated by an Etruscan artist, and dedicated to
the triad Jupiter, Juno, Minerva (in Etruscan, Tin, Uni,
Menerva). Until World War II, when they were wantonly
destroyed, the finds in terracotta from the arx were preserved
in the local museum. There were revetments, plaques
forming a thin veneer of fired clay, with nail-holes for
affixing them to the wooden frame of a typical Tuscan
temple. They included archaic antefixes: ornamental terracotta
caps to mask the unsightly ends of half-round roof
tiles. Terracotta revetments like these, for wooden construction,
continue to be canonical in Roman temples down to
the first century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>: marble as a building material does
not come into use until after the middle of the second century
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Under the lee of the arx was a necropolis with
contents like those found in Gallic graves, mute evidence
of the occupation of Marzabotto by the wave of Gauls that
brought terror into Italy early in the fourth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
In sum, Marzabotto is so perfect an example of an Etruscan
town-site that it merits the name of the Etruscan Pompeii.</p>

<p>Marzabotto remained for many years the only known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
Etruscan site with a grid plan. Lying as it does outside
Etruria proper, it was clearly the product of Etruscan expansion
northward. Since 1922 reclamation by drainage
canals has revealed the necropolis of another northern outpost,
Spina, near one of the mouths of the Po. Working
under the greatest difficulties from mud and seepage, archaeologists
had unearthed the contents of no less than
1213 tombs, often finding golden earrings and diadems
gleaming in the mud against the skulls in the burials. These
precious ornaments, together with necklaces of northern
amber, perfume-bottles in glass paste and alabaster from
Egypt, and Greek black- and red-figured vases, are now the
pride of the Ferrara Museum. Though the vases are Greek,
both Etruscans and Greeks lived in the site together, as is
proved by <i>graffiti</i> in both languages scratched on the pottery.
The spot, commanding the Adriatic, would be the
ideal port of entry for foreign luxury goods imported to
satisfy the taste for display of wealthy Etruscans. Wealthy
as they were, they were all equal in the sight of Charun:
the skeletons were regularly found with small change, to
pay the infernal ferryman, clutched in the bony fingers of
their right hands. Pathetic graves of children contained
jointed dolls and game counters.</p>

<p>(S. Aurigemma, <i>Il R. Museo di Spina in Ferrara</i>, Pl. 4)</p></div></div>

<p>This rich and crowded cemetery was all that was known
of Etruscan Spina until further drainage operations in 1953,
in the Pega Valley, south of the original site (<a href="#ip_2_5">Fig. 2.5</a>),
brought to light not only 1195 new tombs, but also further
surprises. In October, 1956, an air-photograph in color revealed
beneath the modern irrigation canals the grid plan
(<a href="#ip_2_6">Fig. 2.6</a>), resembling Marzabotto’s, of the port area of
the ancient Etruscan city. This time the <i>decumanus</i> is a
canal, sixty-six feet wide, and the marshy site is revealed
as a sort of Etruscan Venice. Later air-photographs showed
evidence of habitation over an area of 741 acres, large
enough for a population of half a million. Since the artifacts
of this vast city are a little later in style than those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of Marzabotto, we assume that Spina flourished a little
later. Almost no weapons were found in the graves: Spina
apparently felt secure on her landlocked lagoon, but she
reckoned without attacks from the landward side. Few
vases datable later than the late fifth century are found
in the graves: the inference is that Spina fell, about 390 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>,
before the same Gallic invasion that despoiled Marzabotto.
The two sites together reinforce each other in giving evidence
for the use by Etruscan city-planners of the kind
of square or rectangular grid of streets later made famous
by Roman colonies and Roman camps; unfortunately the
question is still open whether the Etruscans invented the
grid used in Italy or whether it was a Greek import.</p>

<p>Archaeology tells us something about Etruscan fortifications,
too, not least important being some recent negative
evidence: many polygonal walls in Etruria and Latium,
formerly believed Etruscan, are now proved to be of Roman
date. But excavations conducted since 1947 at Bolsena by
the French school in Rome have unearthed walls that are
genuinely Etruscan, surrounding an Etruscan site, and with
Etruscan letters hacked on the blocks. The marks, concentrated
on strategic sections of the wall, were probably
apotropaic, intended to work as magic charms against the
enemy. One section of the wall was only one block thick.
It could not have been self-standing; it must have been
intended as the spine of an <i>agger</i> or earthwork. Just such
a spine was a part of Rome’s earliest walls, and a similar
technique is to be seen in early earthworks at Anzio and
Ardea. The discovery of these walls has clinched the identification
of Bolsena with Etruscan Volsinii, one of the
twelve cities, and the scene of regular meetings of the
Etruscan League. On the same site were found some temple
foundations, but the district is rich farmland, and it
proved impossible to dig over a wide enough area to discover
whether Volsinii, like Marzabotto and Spina, had a
grid plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
Grid plans suggest a sophisticated, if rigid, political organization
for Etruscan cities. Evidence for the political
life of a civilization normally comes from literature and
inscriptions, very little from artifacts. Yet the Aules Feluskes
stele from Vetulonia, already mentioned, shows a figure
carrying a double-headed ax. Later, axes were carried by
the consul’s twelve bodyguards whom the Romans called
lictors. There seems to be a connection between the number
twelve and the twelve cities of the Etruscan confederacy.
Vetulonia has yielded another object of great interest
to those who would understand Etruscan political organization
and Rome’s debt to it. In the Tomb of the Lictor was
found, besides a chariot and a metal coffer containing gold
objects wrapped in gold leaf, a double-headed iron ax
(<a href="#ip_2_7">Fig. 2.7</a>) hafted onto a single iron rod surrounded by
eight others. This is obviously the prototype of the Roman
<i>fasces</i>, and indeed Silius Italicus, a Roman epic poet of
the Silver Age, assigns the origin of the fasces to Vetulonia.
Such artifacts suggest that the ruler of an Etruscan city,
whether king or aristocrat, was surrounded by considerable
pomp.</p>

<p>Etruscan political organization, according to Latin literary
sources, at one stage embraced Rome, and an Etruscan
inscription on a shiny black dish of the ware called
<i>bucchero</i>, in Rome, goes a little way to confirm this. More
impressive confirmation comes from a frescoed Etruscan
tomb in Vulci, discovered by A. François in 1857. The
fresco has a historical subject, a battle scene, portraying
two camps, populated with figures labelled in Etruscan
letters. The figures in one camp are labelled Aule and Caele
Vipina (in Latin, Vibenna), and Macstrna (in Latin, <i>magister</i>);
in the other, a figure labelled Cneve Tarchunies
Rumach (in Latin, Cn. Tarquinius Romanus), a member
of the dynasty of Roman kings which in the historical tradition
is alleged to have come from Etruria. Aule Vipina’s
name recurs in a votive inscription, from a context dated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
in the sixth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, found at Veii on a <i>bucchero</i> sherd.
The conclusion is inescapable that A. and C. Vibenna were
actual historical figures, Etruscan leaders involved in a
political struggle for the domination of Rome. Macstrna is
identified in Roman tradition with Servius Tullius, a good
king whose rule falls, according to the literary tradition,
between the tyrannical reigns of the two Tarquins. The
fresco may represent an episode in Servius Tullius’ life unknown
to the Roman tradition, before he became king in
Rome; he is represented rescuing C. Vibenna from the
Romans, and killing Tarquin. Thus archaeology here not
only confirms the literary tradition of Rome’s Etruscan
kings; it suggests something about the internal policy of
sixth-century Etruscan cities, the existence in them, perhaps
by a constitutional transformation from an archaic
kingship, of a strong military authority, like that of the
<i>magister populi</i> or dictator of the later Roman Republic.
Etruscan tomb inscriptions, with their many personal names,
show that official Etruscan nomenclature included—as did
the later Roman—the name of the clan. Clan organization
is in origin aristocratic. As later in Rome aristocrats with a
clan organization overthrew the original monarchy, so too,
we may suppose, the clans operated in Etruria.</p>

<p>(<i>Corpus Inscriptionum Etruscarum</i>, no. 5360)</p></div></div>

<p>In the example just cited, light is thrown on Etruscan
political organization by the inscriptions on the fresco, and
it is in fact to inscriptions in the Etruscan alphabet (<a href="#ip_2_8">Fig. 2.8</a>)
that we owe most of what we know about Etruscan
politics. For, paradoxically, though Etruscan, as a non-Indo-European
language, is technically indecipherable (in
the sense that the longest inscriptions in it cannot be entirely
translated), valid inferences can be made about some
of the short ones. For example, one of the inscriptions on
the wall of the Tomb of Orcus at Tarquinia, discovered
in 1868 (<a href="#ip_2_9">Fig. 2.9</a>), reads in part <i>zilath : amce : mechl : rasnal</i>,
at first sight a most unlikely combination of letters. Another
Tarquinian inscription, this time from a sarcophagus in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
local museum (splendidly installed in the fifteenth century
Vitelleschi palace) reads in part <i>zilath rasnas</i>. If we extrapolate
from the Roman practice of recording on funerary
monuments the official career (<i>cursus honorum</i>) of the
deceased (beginning with the highest offices held), it appears
likely that the term <i>zilath</i> refers to a magistracy. It
occurs often, and, when it occurs in a series, it occurs early;
this warrants the inference that it refers to an important
magistracy. Certain late Latin inscriptions from Etruria
refer to a <i>praetor Etruriae</i>. Might not the <i>zilath</i> be the
Etruscan official corresponding to the Roman praetor? This
is the more likely since the words <i>rasnal</i>, <i>rasnas</i> closely
resemble the word <i>Rasenna</i>, which a Greek historian tells
us is what the Etruscans called themselves in their own
language. There remains the word <i>mechl</i>. A similar word,
<i>methlum</i>, occurs next to the word <i>spur</i> in a curious text,
the longest we have in Etruscan, written on the cloth of a
mummy wrapping now preserved in the museum of Zagreb,
in Jugoslavia. The context appears to list the institutions
for whose benefit certain religious ceremonies were performed.
Several names of offices are accompanied, and
probably modified, by the words <i>spureni</i>, <i>spurana</i>. It looks
as if the word means “city.” Suppose the other institution,
the <i>methlum</i>, mentioned next to the <i>spur</i>, were of larger
size. Might it not be the Etruscan for “League”? The Tomb
of Orcus inscription, then, might mean, “He was the chief
magistrate of the Etruscan League.” It is by inferences like
these that we force a language technically indecipherable
to tell us something about the political organization of the
mysterious people who spoke and wrote it.</p>

<p>Another example comes from a long inscription on a
scroll held in the hands of a sculptured figure on another
sarcophagus in the Tarquinia museum. It contains the word
<i>lucairce</i>. In the text of the Zagreb mummy-wrapping mention
is made of ceremonies celebrated <i>lauchumneti</i>, presumably
a noun with an ending showing a place relation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
and obviously related in root to <i>lucairce</i>. And both seem
connected with the word <i>lucumo</i>, used in Latin to refer
to Etruscan chiefs or kings. <i>Lucairce</i> contains the ending
<i>-ce</i> which we interpreted on the Tomb of Orcus inscription
as verbal; it might mean “was king (or chief).” In that case
<i>lauchumneti</i>, with its locative ending, might mean “in the
(priest)-king’s house” (Latin <i>Regia</i>). Thus by reasoning
from the known to the unknown we can find evidence from
the Etruscans themselves that at some stage they were
ruled by kings. Since the Tarquinia sarcophagus with the
scroll is on the evidence of artistic techniques dated late
(second century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, a date at which the Roman Republic
fully controlled Etruria), we must suppose that by that
date the <i>lucumo</i> had been reduced to a mere priestly function,
much as in Rome itself the priest who in Republican
times discharged the sacred duties once performed by
Rome’s kings (<i>reges</i>) was still called the <i>rex sacrorum</i>.</p>

<p>A final example. On Etruscan inscriptions occurs a root
<i>purth-</i>, with by-forms <i>purthne</i>, <i>purtsvana</i>, <i>eprthne</i>, <i>eprthni</i>,
<i>eprthnevc</i>. This looks like the root which occurs in the
name of the king of Clusium, transliterated by the Romans
Lars Porsenna, he who in the <i>Lays of Ancient Rome</i> swore
by the Nine Gods. The same root probably occurs in the
Greek <i>prytanis</i>, which means something like “senator.”
Clearly another official of importance is referred to here.</p>

<p>In sum, archaeologists looking for evidence of Etruscan
political organization have found such outward signs of
pomp as fasces, plus evidence for magistrates resembling
the later Roman dictator, praetor, priest-king, senator, and
for cities probably combined into a league.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>If inscriptions can be made to yield this kind of evidence,
what can we say about the state of our knowledge about
the Etruscan language in general? The same kind of combinatory
method applied to other inscriptions yields with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
patience results justifying the statement that progress,
though agonizingly slow, is being made. Many short inscriptions
can be read entire: they are usually funerary,
and give the names, filiation, and age of the deceased. Here
is an example, from yet another sarcophagus in the Tarquinia
museum:</p>

<p class="p1 b1 in0 in2">
<i>partunus vel velthurus</i> <span class="in2"><i>satlnal-c</i></span> <span class="in2"><i>ramthas clan</i></span><br />
“Partuni Vel of Velthur and of Satlnei Ramtha the son,<br />
<i>avils</i> <span class="in2"><i>XXIIX lupu</i></span><br />
of years 28, <span class="in2">dead.</span>”
</p>

<p>Here for translation one assumes that Etruscan, while not
Indo-European in its roots, is an inflected language, where
an <i>-s</i> or <i>-l</i> ending shows possession, and the enclitic <i>-c</i>,
like the Latin <i>-que</i>, means “and.” Another example shows
similar case-endings, uses vocabulary we have seen before,
and adds a place-name:</p>

<p class="p1 b1 in0 in2">
<i>Alethnas Arnth</i> <span class="in2"><i>Larisal</i></span> <span class="in1"><i>zilath Tarchnalthi amce</i></span><br />
“Alethna Arnth (son) of Laris praetor at Tarquinia was.”
</p>

<p>Altogether some 10,000 Etruscan inscriptions are known.
Of these only three are of any length: the Zagreb mummy-wrapping,
a tile from Capua, and the previously mentioned
scroll from Tarquinia. The next seven taken together total
less than 100 words. Given this material, there is some bitter
truth in the statement that if we could unlock the secret
of Etruscan, we would have the key to an empty room.
But whole cities in Etruria remain to be dug; there is no
knowing what new inscriptions excavations now in progress
at Vulci, Roselle, or Santa Severa may turn up, including
perhaps a bilingual, where identical texts in Etruscan
and a known language like Latin may solve the puzzle,
as the Greek of the Rosetta Stone made possible the deciphering
of Egyptian hieroglyphics. Etruscan loan-words
in Latin tell us something: <i>antemna</i>, “yard-arm”; <i>histrio</i>,
“actor”; <i>atrium</i>, “patio”; <i>groma</i>, “plane-table” suggest Etruscan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
predominance on the sea and the stage, in domestic
architecture and surveying. But we know more than loan-words:
the known vocabulary in Etruscan amounts now to
122 words, in seven categories, including time-words (<i>e.g.</i>,
the names of several months), the limited political vocabulary
already discussed, names for family relationships, some
three dozen verbs and nouns, and the same number of
words from the field of religion.</p>

<p>It is about Etruscan religion, and especially funerary
rites, that we are best informed. The Etruscans had the
reputation of being the most addicted to religious ceremonial
of any people of antiquity, and we learn much
about Etruscans living from Etruscans dead. We know
what sort of documentation to expect on religious matters
from an Etruscan tomb, by extrapolating back from rites
which the Romans believed they had inherited from Etruria,
especially in the area of foretelling the future by examining
the livers of animals (hepatoscopy) or observing the
flights of birds (augury). One of the most curious surviving
documents of Etruscan superstition is the bronze model
of a sheep’s liver (<a href="#ip_2_10">Fig. 2.10</a>) found in 1877 near Piacenza,
on the upper Po, and now in the Civic Museum there. The
liver is split in two lengthwise. From the plane surface
thus provided three lobes project. The plane surface itself
is subdivided into sixteen compartments (<a href="#ip_2_11">Fig. 2.11</a>); over
each compartment a god presides. The same sixteen subdivisions
were used in the imaginary partition of the sky
for augury, and the same principle governed the layout
and orientation of cities like Marzabotto and probably
Spina. The same superstition found in Babylonia directs
our attention once more to the probable Near Eastern
origin of the Etruscan ruling class. The priest would take
his position at the cross-point of the intended <i>cardo</i> and
<i>decumanus</i> of the city, facing south (we recall that the
three-celled temple on the <i>arx</i> at Marzabotto faces south).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
The half of the city behind him was called in Latin the
<i>pars postica</i> (posterior part), the part in front of him the
<i>pars antica</i> (anterior part); on his left was the <i>pars familiaris</i>
(the lucky side; hence thunder on the left was a good
omen) on his right the <i>pars hostilis</i> (unlucky). To the subdivision
of the earth below corresponded a similar subdivision
of the sky above; either was called in Latin (using
a concept clearly derived from Etruscan practice) a <i>templum</i>,
“part cut off,” a sacred precinct, terrestrial or celestial.
From the Piacenza liver and the orientation of Marzabotto
we can deduce both the orderliness of the Etruscan mind
and the ease with which it degenerated into rigidity and
superstition. For this deadly heritage the Etruscans apparently
found in the Romans willing recipients; often, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
not always, for old Cato said, “I cannot see how one liver-diviner
can meet another without laughing in his face.”</p>

<p>The vast number of Etruscan tombs and the richness of
their decoration and furnishings tell us much about another
aspect of the Etruscans’ religion: their view of the afterlife.
About this the fabulous painted tombs of Tarquinia
tell us most, and bid fair to tell us more as new methods
are applied to their discovery and exploration. The ubiquitous
Bradford has been at work in Etruria too; his quick
eye has detected on air-photographs over 800 new tomb-mounds
at Tarquinia alone, and new methods of ground
exploration, worked out by the dedicated Italian engineer
C. M. Lerici, have enormously speeded the work of exploration.
Electrical-resistivity surveying with a potentiometer,
sensitive to the difference between solid earth and empty
subterranean space, makes possible the rapid tracing of a
profile showing where the hollows of Etruscan tombs exist
underground (<a href="#ip_2_12">Fig. 2.12</a>). A hole is then drilled large enough
to admit a periscope; if the periscope shows painted walls,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
or pottery, a camera can be attached to make a 360-degree
photograph. By this method Lerici reports exploring 450
tombs in 120 days. This work, rapid as it is, is being done
none too soon; land redistribution schemes, good for the
farmer, bad for the archaeologist, are changing the face of
south Etruria day by day; deep plowing and the planting
of vines and fruit trees are destroying or obscuring the
archaeological picture.</p>

<p>Dennis would hardly lament the passing of the conditions
he so graphically describes: “Among the half-destroyed
tumuli of the Montarozzi [at Tarquinia] is a pit, six or
eight feet deep, overgrown by lentiscus; and at the bottom
is a hole, barely large enough for a man to squeeze himself
through, and which no one would care to enter unless
aware of something within to repay him for the trouble,
and the filth unavoidably contracted. Having wormed myself
through this aperture, I found myself in a dark, damp
chamber, half-choked with the <i>debris</i> of the walls and
ceiling. Yet the walls have not wholly fallen in, for when
my eyes were somewhat accustomed to the gloom, I perceived
them to be painted, and the taper’s light disclosed
on the inner wall a banquet in the open air.” Modern gadgetry
like Lerici’s has destroyed some of the romance; there
is something graphic about descriptions like Mengarelli’s
of opening a tomb at Cerveteri in 1910, in the presence of
the local and neighboring landlords, the Prince and Princess
Ruspoli and the Marchese Guglielmi. As the blocks of the
entrance were removed one by one, and sunlight was reflected
into the tomb by mirrors, there were to be seen
against the black earth objects of gleaming gold, and priceless
proto-Corinthian vases resting on shreds of decomposed
wood, which were all that was left of the funeral bed,
while other vases were to be seen fixed to the wall with
nails.</p>

<p>The Tomb of Hunting and Fishing at Tarquinia, discovered
in 1873, gives us our most attractive picture (<a href="#ip_2_13">Fig. 2.13</a>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
of how Etruscans in their palmiest days viewed the next
world. The tomb is dated by the black-figured Attic vases
it contained in the decade 520–510 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, when the Etruscan
ruling class was still prosperous. A more charming invitation
to the brainless life could hardly be imagined. The most
vivid scene is on the walls of the tombs inner room, which
are conceived as opening out into a breezy seascape, with
a lively population of bright birds in blue, red, and yellow,
frisky dolphins, and boys, friskier still, at play. Up a steep
rock striped in clay-red and grass-green clambers a sun-burnt
boy in a blue tunic, who appears to have just pushed
another boy who is diving, with beautiful form, into the
hazy, wine-dark sea. On a nearby rock stands another boy
firing at the birds with a slingshot. Below him is a boat
with an eye painted on the prow (to ward off the evil eye;
fishing boats are still so painted in Portugal). Of the boat’s
four passengers, one is fishing over the side with a flimsy
handline, while beside the boat a fat dolphin turns a mocking
somersault. All is life, action, humor, vitality, color;
such is the notion of blessed immortality entertained by
a people for whom Gods in his heaven, all’s right with

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 2.14</span> Tarquinia: Tomb of Orcus, portrait of the lady Velcha. (MPI)</div></div>

<p>A quarter of a century or so after the Tomb of Hunting
and Fishing was painted, the Etruscans suffered a major
naval defeat at the hands of Greeks off Cumae. Rome, expanding,
eventually took over the iron mines of Elba and
the iron-works of Populonia, and Etruscan prosperity declined
agonizingly to its end. Let us look at a Tarquinian
tomb of the period of the decadence; <i>e.g.</i>, the Tomb of
Orcus again. There, beside one of the loveliest faces ever
painted by an ancient artist (<a href="#ip_2_14">Fig. 2.14</a>), is portrayed one
of the most hair-raising demons a depressed imagination
could conceive (<a href="#ip_2_15">Fig. 2.15</a>). Its flesh is a weird bluish-green,
as though it were putrefying. Its nose is the hooked beak
of a bird of prey. The fiend has asses’ ears; its hair is a
tangled mass of snakes. Beside its monstrous wings rises<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50<br /><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
a huge crested serpent, horribly mottled. In its left hand
the demon holds a hammer handle. An inscription identifies
him as Charun, the ferryman of the dead; it is to pay
this monster that the skeletons of Spina clutch their bronze
small change in their right hands. The contrast between the
gaiety of the scenes in the Tomb of Hunting and the gloomy
prospect of the lovely lady—her name is Velcha—in the
clutches of this grisly demon has been held to epitomize
the contrast between the views of an after life entertained
by a prosperous and by an economically depressed people.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 2.15</span> Tarquinia: Tomb of Orcus, the demon Charun. (MPI)</div></div>

<p>Other finds cast further light. The Capua tile prescribes
funerary offerings to the gods of the underworld. An inscribed
lead plaque from near Populonia is a curse tablet,
in which a woman urges Charun or another infernal deity,
Tuchulcha, to bring his gruesome horrors to bear on members
of her family whose death she ardently desires. Bronze
statuettes give details of priestly dress (conical cap tied
under the chin, fringed cloak) or show Hermes, Escorter
of Souls, going arm-in-arm with the deceased to the world
below. The total picture is one of a deeply religious, even
superstitious people, attaching particular importance to the
formalities of their ritual relations with their gods, and
obsessed with the after life, of which they take a progressively
gloomier view as their material prosperity declines.</p>

<p>What can archaeology tell us about Etruscan cultural
life? Of art for art’s sake there seems to have been very
little, of literature none, except for liturgical texts. The
Etruscans excelled in fine large-scale bronze work, like the
famous Chimaera of Arezzo or the Capitoline Wolf, but
their minor masterpieces in bronze deserve mention also,
especially the engraved mirrors, the cylindrical cosmetic
boxes called <i>ciste</i>, and the statuettes whose attenuated
bodies appeal strongly to modern taste. Their painting at
its best shows in its economy of line how intelligently they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
borrowed from the Greeks, in its realism how sturdily they
maintained their own individuality. In architecture, Etruscan
temples, having been made of wood, do not survive
above their foundation courses, but recent discoveries of
terracotta temple-models at Vulci tell us something about
their appearance, and masses of their terracotta revetment
survive, brightly-painted geometric, vegetable, or mythological
motifs, designs to cover beams, mask the ends of
half-round roof tiles, or (in pierced patterns called <i>à jour</i>
crestings) to follow the slope of a gable roof. Made from
molds, the motifs could be infinitely repeated at small expense,
an aspect of Etruscan practicality which was to appeal
strongly to the Romans.</p>

<p>But the Etruscans’ artistic genius shows at the best in
their architectural sculpture in painted terracotta, free-standing
or in high relief. Their best-known masterpiece
in this genre is the Apollo of Veii (<a href="#ip_2_16">Fig. 2.16</a>), designed for
the ridgepole of an archaic temple. Discovered in 1916,
it is now in the Villa Giulia museum in Rome. The stylized
treatment of the ringlets, the almond eyes, the fixed smile
are all characteristic of archaic Greek art, and the fine edges
of the profile, lips, and eyebrows suggest an original in
bronze. But this is no mere copy. It is the work of a great
original artist, probably the same Vulca of Veii who was
commissioned in the late sixth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> to do the terracottas
for the Capitoline temple in Rome. The sculptor is
telling the story of the struggle between Apollo and Hercules
for the Hind of Ceryneia: the god is shown as he
tenses himself to spring upon his opponent; the anatomical
knowledge, the expression of mass in motion, and the craftsmanship
required to cast a life-size terracotta (a feat which
even now presents the greatest technical difficulties) are
all alike remarkable.</p>

<p>A set of antefixes (used, as we have seen, to cover the
ends of half-round roof-tiles), from the archaic temple at
Satricum in Latium, in the same museum, are noteworthy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
for their humor. They represent a series of nymphs pursued
by satyrs. The satyrs are clearly not quite sober, and the
nymphs are far from reluctant. In a particularly fine piece
(<a href="#ip_2_17">Fig. 2.17</a>) the satyr frightens the nymph with a snake
which he holds in his left hand, while he slips his right
hand over her shoulder to caress her breast. Her gestures
are almost certainly not those of a maiden who would
repel a man’s advances.</p>

<p>A third Etruscan masterpiece in terracotta, of later date,
but still showing the same striking vitality as the two pieces
just described, is the pair of winged horses in high relief
(<a href="#ip_2_18">Fig. 2.18</a>), first published in 1948, which come probably
from the pediment of the temple called the Ara della
Regina, on the site of the Etruscan city (as opposed to
the necropolis) of Tarquinia, and now in the Tarquinia
museum. The proud arching of the horses’ necks, their
slim legs, their rippling muscles are rendered to make them
the quintessence of the thoroughbred, so that we forget
that the delicate wings would scarcely lift their sturdy
bodies off the ground. In these three masterpieces art is
none the less vibrant for being put at the service of religion.
Here is created a new Italic expressionistic style, so
admirable that many would hold that Italian art did not
reach this level again until the Renaissance.</p>

<p>Just as archaeology’s finds can convince us of the vitality
of Etruscan art, so they can bring to life ancient Etruscan
life and customs. Most illuminating in this area are two
tombs from Cerveteri, ancient Caere, one of the great cities
of the Etruscan dodecapolis, twenty-five miles up the coast-road
from Rome, and close, too, in cultural relations. Here
again Bradford has been at work, spotting over 600 new
tombs, but the one that tells us most about Etruscan everyday
life has been known since 1850. It is the fourth-century
Tomb of the Reliefs (<a href="#ip_2_19">Fig. 2.19</a>), with places for over forty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
bodies. The front and back walls of this tomb, and two
pillars in the middle, are covered with representations in
low relief of Etruscan weapons and objects in daily use;
here, as elsewhere in Etruscan tombs, but in far more detail,
the tomb-chamber reproduces the look of a room in
an Etruscan house. Such chambers served again as shelters
in modern times—against bombs in World War II. In the
central recess in the farthest wall is a bed for a noble
couple. It is flanked by pilasters bearing medallions of
husband (on the left) and wife (on the right). On the
husband’s side appears the end of a locked strongbox, covered
with raised studs or bosses, with a garment lying
folded on top. On the wife’s side is a sturdy knotted
walking-staff, a garland, necklaces, and a feather fan. The
couch has lathe-turned legs; it is decorated with a relief
of Charun and the three-headed dog Cerberus, with a serpent’s
tail. The couch rests on a step on which a pair of
wooden clogs awaits their master’s need. Above the couch,
and continuing all the way around the room, is a frieze
of military millinery: helmets with visors, helmets with
cheek-pieces, the felt cap worn under the helmet to keep
the metal from chafing, swords, shields, greaves or shin
guards, and a pile of round objects variously interpreted
as missiles, decorations for valor, or balls of horse-dung.
The central pilasters, with typical Etruscan economy, are
decorated only on the sides visible from the door. What is
represented is the whole contents of an Etruscan kitchen.
Identifiable objects include a sieve, a set of spits for roasting,
a knife-rack, an inkpot, a dinner gong, a game board
(not unlike those provided in English pubs for shove-ha’penny)
with a bag for the counters, and folding handles;
a ladle, mixing spoons, an egg-beater, pincers, a duck, a
tortoise, a cat with a ribbon around its neck, playing with
a lizard; a belt, a pitcher, a long thin rolling pin for making
macaroni, a pickaxe, a machete, a coil of rope, a pet weasel
teasing a black mouse, a <i>lituus</i> (the augur’s curved staff),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
a wine-flask of the familiar Chianti shape, a knapsack, and
a canteen. Over and flanking the door are <i>bucrania</i> (ox-skulls),
wide, shallow sacrificial basins, and a curved war-trumpet
or hunting-horn. Surely never a household embarked
better equipped for the next world. This tomb is
as good as a documentary film; nothing ever found by
archaeology brings Etruscan daily life more vividly before
our eyes.</p>

<p>While the Tomb of the Reliefs is full of homely details
of Etruscan life, the Regolini-Galassi tomb, also at Cerveteri,
was crammed with objects of conspicuous consumption
and conspicuous waste. The tomb is named for its discoverers,
General Alessandro Regolini and Fr. Vincenzo Galassi,
arch-priest of Cerveteri in 1836. Its contents are datable in
the eighth or seventh century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> It consists of a long
narrow entrance-way or <i>dromos</i>, two oval side-chambers,
and a long narrow main tomb-chamber roofed with a false
vault, “now,” says Dennis, “containing nothing but slime
and serpents.” When it was entered through a hole in the
roof on April 21, 1836, an incredible treasure of gold, silver,
bronze, and ceramics, over 650 objects in all, burst upon
the workmen’s gaze. All was cleared with feverish haste
in less than twenty-four hours, and no detailed inventory
was compiled until seventy years later. The riches are fabulous;
to quote Dennis again, “here the youth, the fop, the
warrior, the senator, the priest, the belle, might all suit
their taste for decoration—in truth a modern fair one need
not disdain to heighten her charms with these relics of a
long past world.” In those days, Etruscan objects were not
allowed to languish in a museum. A report of 1839 states,
“a few winters ago the Princess of Canino [wife of Lucien
Bonaparte] appeared at some of the [British] ambassador’s
fêtes with a <i>parure</i> of Etruscan jewellery which was the
envy of the society, and excelled the <i>chefs-d’oeuvre</i> of Paris
or Vienna.” Though the contents of the tomb have been
now for many years the pride of the Gregorian Museum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
in the Vatican, the definitive publication did not appear
until 1947.</p>

<p>The tomb contained three burials, including one of a
woman of princess’ rank. With one of the males was buried
his chariot (which was first dismantled and its wooden
parts ceremoniously burned); his funeral car, plated with
bronze in a sword-like leaf design; and his bronze bier, with
a raised place for the head and a latticework of twenty-nine
thin bronze bars. With the woman was buried a priceless
treasure of gold, of baroque barbarity: a magnificent golden
<i>fibula</i>; a great gold pectoral (<a href="#ip_2_20">Fig. 2.20</a>) decorated in <i>repoussé</i>
with twelve bands of animal figures (this, one would
like to think, was what the Princess of Canino wore to the
ambassador’s party); gold and amber necklaces; massive
gold bracelets and earrings to match the pectoral; silver
bracelets, rings, pins, a spindle, and buckets, the latter
decorated with fantastic animals; ivory dice; a bronze wine-bowl,
with a beautiful green patina, decorated with six
heads of lions and griffins, turned inwards; and (reconstructed)
a great bronze-plated chair of state with footstool,
the whole ornamented with vegetable and animal
motifs; the arms end in horse’s heads, the back legs in cow’s
hoofs. To the second male burial belonged a set of splendid
bronze parade-shields; a bronze incense-burner on wheels,
with a rim of lotus-flowers in bronze; a bronze vase-stand,
with a conical base surmounted by two superimposed oblate
spheroids, supporting a bronze container for the vase, the
whole ornamented in <i>repoussé</i> with bulls and winged and
wingless lions; bowls in silver and silver-gilt, decorated
with horsemen, footsoldiers, archers, lancers, chariots, lions,
dogs, bulls, vultures, and palm trees, in a style that might
be Egyptian, Cypriote, or Syrian. Such of the treasure as
is imported from the Near East bespeaks the wealth of
Etruscan overlords; such as is of local manufacture bespeaks
the Skill of Etruscan craftsmen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
From other places, other clues to Etruscan life and customs.
We may end with two observations, both taken from
tombs in Tarquinia: Etruscan women were treated on a
par with men; Etruscan sports were sometimes of barbaric
cruelty. The Tomb of the Leopards in Tarquinia (fifth
century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) shows women (with dyed hair) reclining on
the same dining-couch with men; later (Tomb of the
Shields, third century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) women sat at meals, while men
reclined, but the sexes dined together; there was no Oriental
seclusion. The Tomb of the Chariots, also in Tarquinia,
shows women along with men in the stands watching athletic
events: horse-racing, the pole-vault, boxing, wrestling,
discus-throwing, and running. A tomb discovered by Lerici
just in time to be restored for the 1960 Olympic Games in
Rome is called the Tomb of the Olympic Victors, and shows
similar events.</p>

<p>But Etruscan spectator sports were not always so innocent.
On the right wall of the Tomb of the Augurs in Tarquinia,
a masked figure, in a false beard, a blood-red tunic,
and a conical cap, is portrayed inciting a fierce hound to
attack a hairy-chested figure, nude but for a loin-cloth and
carrying a club; his eyes are blinded by a sack tied over
his head, and his movements are impeded by a cord held
by a bystander. The victim is already bleeding from several
savage bites. Unless, handicapped as he is, he can
club the dog to death, he will surely be torn to bits. Perhaps
this sanguinary and savage scene represents human
sacrifice (and, if so, it is none the less forbidding), but
it is a tempting hypothesis that what we have pictured
here is a predecessor of the kind of spectacle the Romans
later enjoyed in their amphitheaters, when gladiators fought
to the death. Gladiatorial contests were in fact traditionally
of Etruscan origin, first imported from Etruria for certain
funeral games in 264 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>We end, then, where we began, with archaeological evidence
for Etruscan influence, for good or for ill, upon Rome.
As with the story of prehistoric man in Italy, the Etruscan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
story is one of influences in part originating in the Near
East, in part indigenous, creating a civilization with durable
elements that could be and were transmitted, playing a
predominant rôle in forming the culture of ancient Italy.
The Etruscans are important in themselves, of course, but
it is a mistake to assume, because their language, unique
on the Italian peninsula, is non-Indo-European, that their
culture is isolated, too. As a culture of cities, Etruria must
have had its effect, not without cross-fertilization from Greek
practice, upon Roman town-planning. Etruscan political
forms and practice recur in Roman usage. The language
claims our attention for the light it throws, however dimly,
on Etruscan politics, religion, and family life, and for the
challenge it has presented to modern scientific scholarship
to penetrate its mystery. Etruscan religion, as illuminated
by archaeological finds, has its own fascination, foreshadows
Roman formalism, and is noteworthy for changing, under
the stress of political and economic decline, from an optimistic
to a pessimistic view of the after-life. Etruscan art,
especially terracotta sculpture, shows a striking vitality,
humor, and independence; Etruscan architecture makes its
impact upon Roman. Finally, the evidence of artifacts as
to Etruscan daily life shows a standard of material comfort,
and even of luxury, not to be achieved again on the
peninsula for two hundred years. Etruscan equality of sexes
foreshadows the independence of Roman women; the brutality
of Etruscan games is to strike an answering chord in
sadistic Roman breasts. Etruria has its own intrinsic fascination,
yet for the Western world its major interest must
lie in its legacy to Home. When Etruscan culture was at
its brilliant, golden height, Rome was a primitive village
of wattle-and-daub huts. Archaeology has been able to trace
the metamorphosis of those huts into palaces, with all the
concomitant story of grandeur and barbarity; to that metamorphosis
the rest of this book will be devoted.</p>

<span class="subhead">Early Rome</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Everyone remembers that Augustus left Rome a city of
marble, but too few people recall that he found it a city
of brick. The picture of Rome in most people’s minds is
of a marble metropolis, proud mistress of a Mediterranean
Empire. This to be sure she eventually became, but the
archaeological evidence is that until the end of the third
century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Rome looked tawdry, with patched temples
and winding, unpaved streets. To trace the development is
fascinating, and archaeology is our chief guide.</p>

<p>The story that we read from the earth begins not in
Rome itself but in the Alban Hills, extinct volcanoes in
the Roman Campagna, sixteen miles southeast of Rome,
close to Castel Gandolfo, the lovely lakeside spot where
nowadays the Pope has his summer palace. Here, in a
pastureland called the Pascolare di Castello, some peasants
in 1817 were cutting trenches for planting vineyards. Under
the topsoil of the Alban Hills is a thick bed of solid lava,
called tufa, which seals in a layer of ashes. In digging their
trench the peasants cut through the lava seal and revealed
large <i>dolia</i>, jars of rough clay, each of which contained,
in an urn shaped like a miniature oval hut, the ashes of a
cremation burial, together with <i>fibulae</i>, objects in amber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
and bronze, and numerous vases. It was not until fifty years
later that a committee of experts, including the same Pigorini
who afterwards overstepped his evidence about the
<i>terremare</i>, first connected the burials with the city of Alba
Longa, traditionally founded in the mists of prehistory by
the son of Aeneas. In 1902, in cremation graves from a
necropolis to which we shall return, on the edge of the
Roman Forum itself, hut-urns and artifacts were found so
similar to those from the Pascolare that the inference of
cultural connection was inescapable. Whether Alba Longa
was the metropolis and Rome the colony, as stated by the
literary sources, or the other way about, was not evident
from the artifacts.</p>

<p>A necropolis or graveyard implies an inhabited site. The
inhabited site of Alba Longa was destroyed by the Romans
about 600 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Where was the inhabited site that used the
Forum in Rome as a necropolis? It could hardly have been
the Forum itself, which was a swamp not drained and fit
for habitation until about 575 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, a date which, as we
shall see, marks the end of the necropolis. Could it have
been the Palatine Hill which rises from the south side of
the Forum? At first sight it seemed unlikely that any evidence
for prehistoric habitation could be found on the
Palatine, since the hill was covered with the substructures
of Imperial palaces. But beneath these as early as 1724
were found the remains of the mansions of Republican
nabobs (recorded in literature, too, as having lived here),
and beneath these in turn why should there not lie the
traces of even earlier dwellings? Vergil had pictured Aeneas
humbly entertained on the Palatine by Evander, and lodged
in a hut with swallows under the eaves. Excavations published
in 1906 by the great Italian archaeologist G. Boni
(who lived in a villa on the Palatine, and whose memorial
bust appropriately adorns the Farnese Gardens there)
found under the Flavian Palace traces of huts containing
artifacts matching those found in the Forum necropolis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
These artifacts fell into two phases. The first included
the rough handmade pottery called <i>impasto</i>, which we have
already seen to be characteristic of Villanovan sites; serpentine
<i>fibulae</i> (which match those found in the First
Benacci period at Bologna); ware incised with a clamshell
in dogtooth, meander, and swastika patterns, or with a
rope-like clay <i>appliqué</i>; pierced beads, spools, and a curious
kind of Dutch oven with a perforated top, examples of
which were known from the Forum necropolis and the Alban
Hills, but not elsewhere. Artifacts of a different and more
developed type, belonging, therefore, to a second phase,
included pots with thinner walls, sharper profiles (as seen
in elevation drawings), and more complicated handles; they
are decorated with spirals and semicircles, apparently compass-drawn.
There was even a miniature clay sheepdog,
his curly coat represented by circles impressed with a metal
tube or a hollow reed. Such artifacts match those found in
the evolved Villanovan culture, dated in the first half of
the sixth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> This culture is contemporary with a
rich, sophisticated one in Etruria, but the techniques in
Rome and its vicinity are much more primitive than in
Etruria. We conclude that the Palatine village was infinitely
less prosperous than, say, the contemporary Etruscan cities
of Caere or Tarquinia. But equally primitive artifacts are
found in the Alban Hills burials, certain tombs on the
Quirinal and Esquiline Hills in Rome (discovered when
the city expanded after Italy’s unification in the 1870’s),
and in burials in hollowed-out tree-trunks from the Forum
necropolis, the latter now on display in the Forum Antiquarium.</p>

<p>In 1907 D. Vaglieri began excavations in the southwest
corner of the Palatine which revealed cuttings in the rock.
These were actually, though Vaglieri did not recognize
them as such, cuttings for early Iron Age huts, the date
being an inference from the artifacts, whose stratification
Vaglieri did not record. After a sharp controversy with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Pigorini (whose prestige, because of public interest in the
<i>terremare</i>, was then at its height), the dig was suspended,
leaving one but half-excavated. Here, in this intact area,
excavations were resumed in 1948 by a younger specialist
in the prehistoric archaeology of Italy, S. M. Puglisi. This
time, the methods were rigorously scientific, and the cultural
strata were observed and recorded with meticulous
care. Puglisi recognized that a scientific dig requires the
constant presence on the site during working hours of a
competent archaeologist; no precise results can ever be
obtained by an excavation director who visits his site only
a couple of times a week, since unsupervised workmen can
hardly be expected to respect levels of stratification, preserve
the right artifacts, or keep accurate excavation notebooks,
without which, of course, no scientifically valid
conclusions can be drawn.</p>

<p>In the area left undug by Vaglieri, Puglisi was able to
distinguish five levels, which have been schematically reproduced
on the walls of the Palatine Antiquarium. The
top level consisted of nine feet of ancient dump. But the
four levels beneath the dump amounted to six-and-a-half
feet of compact, undisturbed strata, of which the bottom
eight inches represented what had collected on the hut
floor while it was still in use. Here the sherds were very
tiny, for they had been walked on, it being the regular
practice of Iron Age man—and woman—to live comfortably
in the midst of their own debris. The hearth (one of the
Dutch ovens was discovered in fragments <i>in situ</i>) was near
the center of the hut, very close to a cutting for a central
supporting post—the first evidence ever found for such construction.
But there was no danger of setting the central
post on fire, since the cooking flame was entirely enclosed
within the clay of the oven. Bits of fallen wattle-and-daub
revealed the wall-construction. There were animal bones
and impasto sherds bearing the marks of fire, but none of
the shiny black pottery called <i>bucchero</i> (the best examples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
of which are rarely found in Rome in contexts earlier than
700 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) and no painted ware. This level, then, belonged
to the first phase of the Iron Age, dated, by parallels with
the finds from beneath the Flavian Palace, about 800–700
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> (The traditional date of Rome’s founding is 753.) The
lowest level being so shallow, and the sherds showing the
marks of fire, the inference is that the hut had not been
occupied very long before it was burned down.</p>

<p>The contents of the next superimposed level, two feet
deep, show that the site was next used as a kitchen-midden
or refuse-heap. Here the deposits resemble those from a
well (dug long ago but never described in a detailed scientific
article), in the sanctuary of Vesta in the Forum, which
is dated in the second phase of the Iron Age (700–550 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>),
corresponding in the tradition to the reigns of the five
Roman Kings from Numa to Servius Tullius.<a id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">A</a> These finds
include polished <i>impasto</i>, with high or twisted handles and
out-turned rims; slat-smoothed ware covered with a thin
coating or engobe of reddish clay, ornamented with double
spirals and palmettes, and of a size to fit on the Dutch
ovens; sherds of fine <i>bucchero</i> (the first evidence of imports
from Etruria), and of a coarser grey local imitation;
painted ware, of the style known as sub-Geometric, imported
from south Italy, and also some local imitations identified
by their cruder technique.</p>

<p>The next higher level shows fat-bodied “bloodsucker”
<i>fibulae</i>, and flanged tiles, some with horses molded in low
relief, betraying a completely different and more sophisticated
building technique, like that used in Etruscan temples.
The artifacts matched those found in the level under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
the late Republican House of the Griffins and under the
“House of Livia” on the Palatine, and in the upper strata
of the shrine of Vesta well; they are associated with the
huts built in the Forum after it was drained; that is, with
a transitional period after about 575 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The lower date
suggested by the archaeological finds for this second phase
corresponds to the dates assigned by the literary tradition
to Rome’s Etruscan kings, Tarquin I, Servius Tullius, and
Tarquin the Proud.</p>

<p>The hut itself (<a href="#ip_3_1">Fig. 3.1</a>) was a large one (12 × 16 feet),
sunk about a yard into the tufa of the hill, with six cuttings
for the perimetral posts, two for a front porch, and one
for the central support. The cuttings, averaging fifteen
inches in diameter, are wider than is necessary for posts
to support so flimsy a structure; the logs were probably
held upright by wooden or stone wedges. The hut, reconstructed,
represents a historical fact very much like what
Vergil had in mind when he described the sleeping quarters
assigned by Evander to Aeneas, and such <i>capanne</i> can be
found in out-of-the-way places of the countryside near
Rome even today. Lucretius, Vergil, and Livy all knew
what a Bronze and an Iron Age meant; their generation
venerated a replica of the “Hut of Romulus” on the Palatine.
It suited Augustus’ propaganda purpose to stress
Rome’s rise from humble origins; so, too, to us, archaeology’s
picture of Rome’s primitive beginnings may well make
the story of her later expansion seem more impressive, and
her domination of subject peoples less overbearing.</p>

<p>Archaeology’s second major contribution to our knowledge
of early Rome is provided by Boni’s excavation of
the Forum necropolis (<a href="#ip_3_2">Fig. 3.2</a>), the results of which are
displayed with great clarity in the Forum Antiquarium,
installed in the cloister of the church of S. Francesca Romana
in the Forum itself. The surviving part of the necropolis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
stretches between the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina,
on the north side of the Forum, and a late Republican
structure to the east which was pretty certainly (to judge
from the built-in beds, the narrow rooms, and the analogy
with a building similar in plan at Pompeii, certainly identified
by its erotic pictures) a house of ill-fame. The original
extent west and southward was probably much greater.
The graves have now been filled in, but their sites are
marked by plots of grass, round for cremation graves, oblong
for inhumation ones. The two types sometimes cut
into each other; what inferences are warranted by this fact
are better postponed until we have discussed the grave
contents.</p>

<p>The Forum nowadays is an austere, even at first sight a
forbidding place. It looks much more attractive in a painting
by Claude Lorraine or a print by Piranesi, with a double
row of olives planted down the middle, romantic broken
columns, oxen and peasants scattered about the flowered
greensward in picturesque confusion, and the Arch of
Septimius Severus buried up to its middle. But picturesqueness
is not everything. The Forum is history, stark history;
every stone is soaked in blood. To understand that history,
mere picturesqueness had to be sacrificed; Boni’s graves
are not picturesque; they are informative. From them the
historical imagination can create a picture of Rome’s beginnings
which no Piranesi print could rival.</p>

<p>Sixteen feet of picturesqueness had to be cleared before
Boni could reach the necropolis level. The cremation tombs
are small circular wells, most of them containing, as in the
Alban Hills tombs, a <i>dolium</i> or large jar, covered by tufa
slabs. In the <i>dolia</i> were found ash-containers, often in the
shape of miniatures of huts like the full-sized ones on the
Palatine. The oblong graves contained rough sarcophagi
of tufa, or coffins made of hollowed-out oak logs. Both
types of tomb contained, intact on discovery, tomb furniture
not differing much between the types, and not differing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
much from the finds in the bottom two levels of Puglisi’s
Palatine hut; <i>i.e.</i>, rough <i>impasto</i>, decorated with incised
spirals, parallel lines (done with a comb) or zigzags; <i>bucchero</i>,
some <i>fibulae</i> inlaid with amber, glass beads, tiny
enamel plaques, remains of funeral offerings of food. It is
all very humble, a far cry from the Regolini-Galassi treasure,
though some of the tombs are of the same date. The finds
show that the necropolis was in use from the ninth to the
sixth centuries <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The site was, as we saw, on the edge
of a swamp; when the swamp was drained, the cemetery
went out of use, and huts, of which more later, were built
over it.</p>

<p>In the necropolis, sometimes inhumation graves cut into
cremation ones, sometimes vice versa. There is thus no
ground for assuming that the cremation graves are older,
especially as the grave-contents of the two types are so
similar. The difference is not one of time but of funeral
practice, as today; it suggests two different populations living
peacefully together. The cremators were related to the
people whose graves were found so long ago in the Alban
Hills, and, as we have seen, to the Palatine hut-dwellers.
Who were the inhumers? We know that other Roman hills
than the Palatine were inhabited from very early times,
though the natural features of the Palatine seem to give it
priority: plenty of fodder, abundant water within easy
reach, a retreat made safe at night by the hill and the
river for the people and their livestock.</p>

<p>But habitation of the Esquiline and Quirinal Hills in the
sixth century is attested by a number of tombs from a total
of 164 found there in the 1870’s. The finds from these were
never scientifically recorded, and they have never been
published, but it is noteworthy that they include weapons,
which are absent from the cremation-graves in the Forum.
It looks as though the Esquiline folk were invaders, with a
more warlike tradition than the Palatine hut-dwellers. The
Esquiline folk might earlier have used the Forum necropolis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
for inhumation. We know that the Sabines buried their
dead. Literary tradition (the Rape of the Sabine Women)
records that the early Romans got their wives from among
the Sabines. Numa Pompilius, the second of the legendary
Roman kings, bears a Sabine name. Might not the two
types of graves in the Forum necropolis represent the peaceful
fusion of cremating Latins and inhuming Sabines who
had laid aside their warlike ways?</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>On top of the Forum necropolis, when the swamp was
drained, huts were built. The archaeological evidence for
this phase of early Rome’s history was provided by Boni’s
stratigraphic excavation (recently confirmed by the Swede
Einar Gjerstad) to the northwest of the site of the equestrian
statue of the Emperor Domitian in the middle of the
Forum. Gjerstad dug a trench sixteen feet long and eleven
feet wide, down to virgin soil, which he found nineteen
feet below the present Forum level. On the earth wall of
the trench the story of the centuries could be read in the
successive levels (Figs. <a href="#ip_3_3">3.3</a> and <a href="#ip_3_4">3.4</a>). Between levels three
and nineteen, six pavements could be counted, but level
nineteen takes us, to judge by the pots found in it, only
back to about 450 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> In layers twenty to twenty-two,
Gjerstad found three pebble pavements, which he dates
about 575 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> If he is right in assigning to this date the
beginning of monarchic Rome, he has pushed its date down
in our direction over 150 years from the traditional 753 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
But there is more history below this. Strata twenty-three
to twenty-eight are remains of huts, similar to but (pottery
again) later than the ones on the Palatine. Gjerstad dates
them in two phases: 650–625 and 625–575 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Rather than
push the traditional date down so far, it seems plausible to
suppose that these huts represent the period assigned by
the literary tradition to the early kings, and to argue that
the sophisticated period, symbolized by the Forum’s earliest
pebble pavement, was inaugurated by Rome’s earliest Etruscan
king, Tarquin I.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
These other huts confirm the other archaeological data,
which show that what later was unified into urban Rome
was originally a group of simple hut-villages clustered on
various hills, the Forum huts having spilled down, as it
were, from the village on the Palatine. The huts in the
level just above the Forum necropolis represent a still earlier
stage of this spillover; they antedate the earliest huts
in Gjerstad’s twenty-nine levels. By the date of Gjerstad’s
earliest pebble pavements, the huts in the necropolis area
have been replaced by a more developed domestic architecture,
perhaps with rooms opening on a central court.
These houses have rectangular plans, mud-brick, wood-braced
walls, and tufa foundations. At the spillover stage,
the villagers from the various hills formed some kind of
confederation symbolized archaeologically by the two types
of graves in the Forum necropolis, and in literature by the
tradition of the joint religious festival called the Septimontium.</p>

<p>The period of the first pebble pavement (575 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) is
one of major change, from village to urban life, to a city
now for the first time boasting a civic center, destined to
become the world’s most famous public square, the Roman
Forum. Of the same date are the earliest remains on the
Capitoline Hill, which was to be the <i>arx</i> or citadel of
historic Rome. Of the same date are the earliest artifacts
from the Regia, which later generations revered as the
palace of the kings. Of the same date is a sophisticated
phase of the round shrine of Vesta, which encircled the
sacred flame, symbol of the city’s continuity. The literary
tradition would date the last two earlier, at least to Numa’s
reign. However no architectural remains have so far been
discovered which associate them with the earlier date.</p>

<p>In his interpretation of the archaeological evidence about
the date of the beginning of the Roman Republic, Gjerstad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
is just as iconoclastic as about the dating of the kings.
His argument, more ingenious than convincing, is that an
event as important politically as a change from a monarchy
to a republic should be reflected in the artifacts, changing
from richer to poorer, whereas no such objective evidence
of a cultural break is visible in the levels dated by him
(perhaps more closely than the facts warrant) at 509 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
Such a cultural break does not come until some fifty years
later, when Etruscan imports cease. There are grave difficulties
in pushing the date of the Roman Republic’s beginning
down so far, of which the chief is a list (the <i>Fasti</i>) of
pairs of consuls 509–450 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> where many names are too
obscure to have been invented. Gjerstad’s excavation, in
sum, is important as confirming the accuracy of Boni’s
methods, and as telling us much about the village stage
of Rome, but the absolute chronology cannot be said to
be as yet firmly fixed, nor the traditional one definitely
upset.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Apart from absolute chronology, what unequivocal evidence
can archaeology provide that early Rome was
ruled by kings? The ideal evidence would be an inscription,
and one was discovered in 1899 in the Forum
near the Comitium, where, in the open air in front of the
Senate House, the popular assembly met. The inscription
is called the <i>lapis niger</i> stele, because it lies under a later
pavement of black marble (<i>lapis niger</i>), now preserved
under a deplorable corrugated iron roof. But the stone on
which it is carved is not marble but tufa, identified as
having come from the quarries of Grotta Oscura in the
territory of Veii, some nine miles north of Rome.</p>

<p>On the various kinds of tufa or volcanic stone in use in
early Rome there hangs a tale. In 1924 an American, Tenney
Frank, published an epoch-making study of Roman building
materials in which he put the dating of Roman monuments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
on a firmer basis by distinguishing several different
kinds of tufa used by Roman builders at successive dates.
Subsequent studies have blurred the dividing lines and
shown the possibility of overlap, but Frank’s nice eye for
discriminating tufas has revolutionized the architectural history
of the Roman Republic. The following table illustrates
Frank’s methods:</p>

The <i>lapis niger</i> stele, inscribed on tufa of the second

is right for the king, after due process of law, to confiscate his property.

<p>Obviously the inscription thus restored and interpreted,
marks a spot which is taboo, its ill-omened nature being
further emphasized by the later black marble pavement,
which was fenced off by a balustrade of thin white marble
slabs set on edge. Beside the stele is a U-shaped shrine or
altar,<a id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">B</a> on a higher level and therefore of a later date than
the inscription. Archaeology provides no clue to the purpose
of this structure, but learned Romans believed it
marked the tomb of Romulus, their first king. This would
be a sacred spot indeed, not to be profaned by the feet of
men or animals. From one edge of the shrine run the remains
of a semicircular platform with steps (Figs. <a href="#ip_3_6">3.6</a> and
<a href="#ip_3_7">3.7</a>), also later in date than the inscription. The platform
was the Rostra, so called because of its decoration, after
338 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, with the bronze <i>rostra</i> or ramming-beaks of captured
enemy war-galleys. The Rostra was in historical times
the speakers’ platform; from it in one of its phases resounded
the sonorous oratory of Cicero. But it was also
the spot from which traditionally funeral orations were
delivered, while modern men wearing, according to Roman
custom, the death-masks of their ancestors sat behind the
orators in curule chairs on the platform. To the logical
Roman mind a platform beside the tomb of the first king
would seem the appropriate place for funeral speeches.</p>

<p>Careful equations between the fifteen levels in the Comitium
and the twenty-nine levels near the equestrian statue
of Domitian prove the Comitium a monument of the Roman
Republic: the first phase coincides with the Republic’s beginning,
and its last with Caesar and Augustus, in the late
first century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, when the Republic ends. Thereafter freedom
of speech, and an arena for it, were but a memory.
But the first Rostra rose where it did because the founders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
of the Roman Republic associated it with the first of Rome’s
kings.</p>

<p>The <i>lapis niger</i> inscription, which refers twice to a king,
rests on a base which cannot be older than the sack of Rome
by the Gauls in 390 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> (for the base is on the same level
as the second of the Comitium pavements, laid over traces
of a major fire, and the Gauls set Rome on fire). But an
inscription of course is a movable monument, and the present
location of the stele may not be where it was originally
set up. Furthermore, letter styles so archaic are probably
older than 390 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>: the alternatives, then, are either that
the stele, of venerable antiquity, was reset, on a new platform,
as a part of rearrangements after the fire, or that it
is a deliberately archaizing copy of a much older original.
The theory that the king (<i>rex</i>) referred to is not the temporal
monarch, but the <i>rex sacrorum</i>, a Republican priest
of later Republican times who inherited the king’s religious
functions, is virtually ruled out by the letter-styles.</p>

<p>The <i>lapis niger</i> stele presents one aspect of primitive
Roman religion under the kings: the taboo. Another is the
pious tending of the sacred flame on the public hearth, a
rite performed in historical times by the Vestal Virgins in
Vesta’s shrine at the east end of the Forum. The superstructure
of the shrine as now restored there yielded no
remains earlier than the Gallic fire, but the round plan
must reflect the shape of a primitive straw hut of the Palatine
type, with central hearth and smoke-hole, and the earliest
artifacts, from the previously mentioned well there, are
dated in the seventh and sixth centuries <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The shrine
of Vesta, then, preserves another memory of Rome of the
kings.</p>

<p>Kings, like ordinary mortals, need a dwelling place. Traditionally
in Rome, this was the Regia (related in root to
<i>rex</i>, “king”), on the trapezoidal plot between the Forum
necropolis and Vesta’s shrine (see plan, <a href="#ip_3_8">Fig. 3.8</a>). Romans
believed its first occupant was the Sabine Numa, the second<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
and most pious of the kings, but no archaeological remains
confirm so early a date (traditionally 716–672 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>). It
seems unlikely that the king could have dwelt there before
the necropolis was closed, for the king was a priest, and it
was unlucky for a priest to look upon a cadaver, or upon
death. The earliest datable masonry remains are a foundation
in <i>cappellaccio</i> of about 390 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, another evidence of
rebuilding after the Gallic fire. But there might well have
been, before the fire, a more primitive structure in wood,
revetted in terracotta; indeed, fragments of terracotta revetment,
some of a late sixth or early fifth century style and
some even earlier, were found there, as well as a grey <i>bucchero</i>
sherd scratched with the word <i>rex</i> in archaic letters.
The Regia, as it stands, is the result of at least three rebuildings,
the last in 36 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> It still has an old-fashioned air:
ancient, straggling, intractable, very holy: the shape of its
ground-plan never changing from beginning to end. In keeping
with the Etruscan tradition—as at Marzabotto—the building
is oriented north and south. Its south side was a dwelling,
later the office of the Pontifex Maximus; among the
great Romans who worked in this building was Julius
Caesar. The rest of the Regia was an area partly unroofed.
It was a shrine of Mars, hung with shields and a magic
lance that quivered at the threat of war. The Pontifex
Maximus recorded yearly, day by day, on a whitened board
in the Regia, events in which he and his fellow priests had
a professional interest: temple-dedications, religious festivals,
triumphs, eclipses, famines, rains of blood, births of
two-headed calves, and other prodigies. Fragments of this
lost archaeological record, piously kept by the pontiffs, turn
up in extant Roman history: Livy often refers to them at
the end of his account of a year, particularly an unlucky
year.</p>

<p>Orientation like the Regia’s is an Etruscan practice, and
it is with domination by the Etruscans that we should expect
Rome’s primitive simplicity to evolve into something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
more like grandeur. The literary tradition ascribed to the
Etruscan, Tarquin the Proud, Rome’s last king, a great
Temple of Jupiter on the Capitoline Hill, built by the forced
labor of Roman citizens, and decorated by Etruscan artisans
like Vulca of Veii, the sculptor of the Apollo (page 52).
It took World War I to confirm this literary tradition archaeologically.
The Italians, on the Allied side in that war, ousted
the Germans from their Embassy, splendidly situated on
the Capitoline Hill in the Palazzo Caffarelli, and remodelled
the palace into a museum. In the process was revealed a
massive podium, sixteen feet high, built without mortar of
blocks of <i>cappellaccio</i>, the oldest of Rome’s building stones.
Fortunately, diagonally opposite corners were found, making
it possible to establish how impressive were the podium’s
dimensions: roughly 120 × 180 feet. Three corners of the
podium having been isolated, archaeologists were able to
fit into the plan the remains of a substructure which had
been found in 1865 under the Palace of the Conservatori.
This substructure, now built impressively into a corridor
of the Conservatori Museum, proved to be the support for
columns. The platform as a whole, then, was the podium
of a temple, the largest of its time, over twice the size, for
example, of the one at Marzabotto. Traces of the settings
for the columns proved them to be placed too wide apart
to be connected by architraves in stone; they must instead
have been great wooden beams. The wood would have
been revetted or faced with terracotta, and in fact enough
fragments of terracotta revetments were found on the site
to establish this temple as decorated in the typical Etruscan
style. If its sculptures were as striking as the Apollo of
Veii, they were masterpieces indeed. The temple, repeatedly
and ever more grandiosely rebuilt—in one phase it
was roofed with gilded bronze, and the cult statue was
gold and ivory—was the center and symbol of Rome’s religious
life. Here the triumphal processions ended. Here the
triumphing general, surrounded by his spoils of victory,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
descended from his chariot drawn by four white horses,
and passed through the open doors and the clouds of incense
to give thanks to Jupiter the Best and Greatest for
his victory. From the cliff behind the temple, the Tarpeian
rock, traitors were thrown to their deaths; here, in 133 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>,
Tiberius Gracchus, the friend of the people, was murdered.
Religion, dignity, pride, greed, pomp, tragedy: all are the
stuff of Roman history; all are here, and archaeology illumines
their story. Horace boasted that his poetry would
endure “so long as, with the mute Vestal, the Pontifex
climbs up to the Capitoline Temple.” For him as for us
Rome was the Eternal City, and the Capitoline was the
symbol of its permanence. Through the assaults of riot, fire,
earthquake, poverty, popes, barbarians, limekilns, wind, rain,
and earth, the foundations have endured.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The literary tradition tells us how Rome’s Etruscan monarchy
fell: of Tarquin’s despotism and his son’s rape of
Lucrece, daughter of a Roman aristocrat, whose husband
avenged her and allegedly became one of Rome’s first pair
of consuls. It tells us how the Roman nobles rose, drove
out the Tarquins, and founded the Roman Republic. Archaeology
cannot confirm the traditional date (indeed the
founding of temples, Etruscan style, continues, as we saw,
for half a century after 509). But about the middle of the
fifth century the contents of the tombs on the Esquiline
begin to grow mean and shabby. Contact with Etruria has
been cut off, and the Romans make a virtue of necessity,
pass sumptuary laws against excessive display, and practice
simplicity and frugality. The late fifth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> in Rome,
as archaeology reveals it, is a period of isolation, stagnation,
and retrenchment.</p>

<p>Hardly had the new Roman Republic rallied to conquer
Veii (traditionally in 396 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, after a ten-year siege, like
Troy’s), when the Gauls descended from the north with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
fire and sword. Rome bought them off, and, resisting the
temptation to move to Veii, fell to rebuilding, mindful of
how its ancestors had built their city up out of forest and
swamp; in love with their protecting hills, their fruitful
open spaces, their busy river. The building was done planlessly;
the main concern was to strengthen defenses.</p>

<p>The primitive Rome of separate villages on the hills had
been defended, at most, by separate palisades and ditches.
It is with King Servius that literature associated the Rome
of impressive buildings and a beetling wall, of squared
stone, sturdy enough to repel all invaders. With how much
justification Roman historians called the wall “Servian,” we
are now to learn. The tradition associates Rome’s earliest
wall with Servius Tullius, who falls between the two Tarquins,
and certain surviving traces of earthwork and masonry,
plus the Cloaca Maxima, or Great Drain through
the Forum, are assigned by some archaeologists to the sixth
century. Indeed until 1932 most scholars accepted the sixth-century
date for the whole early circuit. But in that year
the Swedish archaeologist Gösta Säflund (who seven years
later was to explode Pigorini’s myth about the <i>terremare</i>)
published the results of some painstaking fieldwork which
radically changed the picture.</p>

<p>Beginning with the Palatine and working counter-clockwise,
Säflund examined every inch of the surviving circuit
ascribed to Servius (see <a href="#ip_2_3">Fig. 2.3</a>), and for stretches which
had been torn down during Rome’s great expansion (after
she became the capital of a united Italy in the 1870’s) he
had access to unpublished notes and sketches by Boni and
another great nineteenth-century Italian archaeologist, Rodolfo
Lanciani. Everywhere he paid careful attention to
materials, techniques, dimensions, mason’s marks, the relation
of the wall to terrain, neighboring tombs, and ancient
artifacts found in its context. It was chiefly from the building
material that Säflund drew his conclusions.</p>

<p>The stone was in the main Grotta Oscura tufa, which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
knew from Tenney Frank’s studies to have been in use in
the year (378 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) in which Livy says the censors contracted
to have a wall built of squared stone. Furthermore,
some of the Esquiline tombs already mentioned, containing
mid-fourth century artifacts, were outside the line of the
Grotta Oscura wall, while some of the tombs containing
archaic artifacts were inside. The Romans rarely buried
their dead within a city wall: the inference is that at the
date of the earlier tombs, Rome had no proper ring-wall,
while by the date of the later (fourth-century) tombs a
circuit wall had been built. The Great Drain through the
Forum is also of Grotta Oscura, and is therefore probably
to be dated in 378, like the wall, though some feeder lines
are in <i>cappellaccio</i>, which, as we have seen, was the earliest
volcanic stone the Romans used, and we know—because we
know the Forum swamp was drained by 575 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>—that
there must have been some sort of drainage system—possibly
open ditches—earlier than 378.</p>

<p>But Säflund found Fidenae tufa also. This he knew, again
from Frank’s study, to have been in use from about 338
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> down into the second century. It had been used to
patch the wall in places. What more appropriate time for
such repairs than when Hannibal was threatening the city,
in 217 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>? Thereafter, Roman and Latin colonies, advanced
bases, served her in the office of a wall, and her own fortifications
were allowed to fall into disrepair.</p>

<p>But there are places in Rome’s wall where Monteverde
stone has been used for arches, rising from footings set in
concrete; in other places the wall has a concrete core faced
with Anio tufa. Säflund knew that concrete was little in
use in Roman building before 150 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and that it had become
a favorite material by Sulla’s time (see p. <a href="#Page_129">129</a>). Sulla
had marched on Rome in 88 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> and taken it; he must
have reinforced the wall to keep his enemy Marius from
duplicating his own feat. And Sulla included the bridgehead
on the far side of the Tiber in his circuit, reinforced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
the Aventine Hill, and added <i>ballistae</i> (great catapults for
shooting stones) in arched casemates flanking the main
gates.</p>

<p>Thus Säflund distinguished three building periods for
the so-called “Servian” Wall, though none as early as King
Servius Tullius. One section of earth work or <i>agger</i>, on the
Quirinal Hill, faced in part with small blocks of <i>cappellaccio</i>,
looked older than 378 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and Säflund knew from
observations at Ardea, Cerveteri (and, as we now know,
Anzio) that the use of the earthwork was standard in the
sixth century to reinforce weak places on hilly sites. Some
early sixth-century sherds, but none later, were found <i>under</i>
the agger. This helps to confirm that the agger was a part
of Rome’s sixth-century, genuinely Servian defenses, never
a complete ring-wall, but an adjustment and reinforcement
of natural defenses, later incorporated into the circuit wall
of 378 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> A splendid stretch of the facing of this reinforced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
agger, 100 yards, survives today by the Termini
railroad station (<a href="#ip_3_9">Fig. 3.9</a>).</p>

<p>But Säflund’s careful observations did more than redate
the wall in its several phases. By comparison of the mason’s
marks, hacked in Greek letters on the heads of the Grotta
Oscura blocks only, with similar marks found on the blocks
of the fortifications of the Euryalus above Syracuse, in
Sicily (built in the late fifth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> by Dionysius I),
Säflund was able to demonstrate that Rome’s wall was built
by Sicilian workmen, Rome not having the manpower or
the skill at the time. (Dionysius for his wall had employed
6000 men and 500 yoke of oxen.)</p>

<p>The wall of 378 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> is evidence that Rome had emerged
from the doldrums into which the Republic had begun to
sink. Before 390 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> she had depended on men, not walls.
The Gallic sack had proved her not invincible, and had
also, as war emergencies will, produced a new sense of
solidarity. The wall symbolizes it, and so does the bill passed
in 367 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> (while the wall was still under construction),
opening the highest office in the Republic to plebeians. Thus
a reinforced oligarchy was formed, which by 338 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> could
beat its once powerful enemies, the neighboring settlements
linked in the Latin League; proudly (even arrogantly)
mount the beaks of enemy ships on the new Rostra;
and embark upon a career of Manifest Destiny in Italy.
The Republic had reached adulthood.</p>

<p>There were other outward and visible signs of the Republic’s
new maturity and prosperity. The gods deserve
their reward for fighting on the side of the biggest battalions,
and so the expanding Republic built temples. In
another age of arrogant expansion, in 1926, not long before
Säflund began his work on the walls, slum clearance in
front of the Argentina theater (on the site of the portico
of Pompey’s theater, where Caesar was murdered) revealed
the foundations of four Republican temples (<a href="#ip_3_10">Fig. 3.10</a>),
nowadays the haunt of countless tomcats. The gods to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
whom the temples were dedicated being unknown, they
were named, with proper archaeological sobriety, Temples
A, B, C, and D. The foundations of Temple C, the third
from the north, are the deepest; it is therefore the oldest.
It is set in the Italic manner at the back of a high podium,
built of Grotta Oscura tufa; its mason’s marks match those
on the “Servian” wall. Clearly it was built by the same
masons or in the same tradition. The podium carries the
distinction of being the oldest surviving datable public
building in Rome. Terracotta revetments found in excavating
are of fourth century type. Besides meanders, the so-called
“Greek frets” or “key” design, an angular pattern
of lines winding in and out, their decorative motifs include
strigil patterns: parallel troughs, made by the workman’s
thumbs in the wet clay, and then painted in contrasting
colors. The strong curve of the profile resembles that of
the strigil or scraper used by athletes in the gymnasium to
remove caked oil and dirt from their bodies; hence the
name. The roof’s peak and corner ornaments, called <i>acroteria</i>,
have spikes set in the clay to discourage birds from
perching and committing nuisances. This temple and its
three later fellows are still a long way from the grandiose
marble and gold of the Augustan Age, but they are an
equally long way from the primitive wattle-and-daub huts
of the Palatine village. They mark a stage in the painstakingly
unravelled archaeological story of Rome’s expansion,
which we shall follow at various newly-excavated sites in
Italy.</p>

<span class="subhead">Roman Colonies in Italy</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Rome’s wall begun in 378 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> took twenty-five years to
build. However secure she might feel behind it, immediately
beyond the gates lurked enemies. To the north the Gauls,
to the east and south, Italic tribes (whom Rome successively
feared, rivalled, dominated, and invited to partnership; of
these the Samnites were the most fearsome), on the seas the
Syracusan and Carthaginian navies—all represented a clear
and present danger. Rome’s population being inadequate to
keep legions in the field, much less a fleet at sea, against all
these threats at once, she evolved a system of advanced bases,
called Latin colonies (<a href="#ip_4_1">Fig. 4.1</a>), manned partly with trustworthy
local non-Romans, though with a hard core of Roman
legionaries. This avoided undue drain on the Roman manpower,
and placed the responsibility for frontier defense
upon frontiersmen who had the greatest interest in their
own security.</p>

<p>During the last thirty years the efforts of archaeologists of
several nations; for example, Italians at Ostia, Belgians at
Alba Fucens, Americans at Cosa have added much to the
sum of our knowledge of these frontier outposts: their fortifications,
street plan, public buildings, housing arrangements,
and the surveyed (“centuriated”) quarter-sections of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
land (allotments) stretching away from the walls into the
countryside round about. From these brute facts inferences
can be drawn, about what prompted the founding of these
outposts (was the motive always military?), about relations
with neighbors and with Rome, about communications,
about economic, social, and cultural life.</p>

<p>At Ostia, at the Tiber’s mouth, historical tradition said
that there had been Romans settled since the days of King
Ancus Marcius, and that, even earlier, Aeneas had landed
there and built a camp. In 1938 the great Italian archaeologist
Guido Calza began soundings to ascertain the date of
the oldest surviving stratum. The area he chose was beneath
Ostia’s Imperial Forum, where the two main streets, the
<i>cardo</i> and the <i>decumanus</i>, crossed. (The Via Ostiensis,
from Rome to the river mouth, determined the line of the
<i>decumanus</i>.) What he found (<a href="#ip_4_2">Fig. 4.2</a>) was a set of walls
enclosing a rectangle 627 feet long and 406 feet wide. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
wall was built of roughly squared blocks of tufa in a technique
not unlike that of Rome’s wall of 378 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, but since
there was Fidenae stone in it, Calza dated the wall somewhat
later than 378. The wall was pierced by four gates
of two rooms each, with portcullis. The south gate was
demolished in the early Empire to provide space for a temple
of Rome and Augustus; the north gate gave way under
Hadrian to the massive podium of a Capitolium, but the
footings of the east and west gates survive, well below the
level of the Imperial pavement. Calza found drains within
the walls, and traces of four other streets (unpaved) besides
the <i>cardo</i> and <i>decumanus</i>, but no identifiable buildings.
Some terracotta revetments found in the area suggest an
unidentified temple of the third century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> No traces
earlier than the late fourth-century wall have been found
in the excavated area of Ostia. Either Ancus Marcius’
foundation is a myth, or it was planted in some thus far
undiscovered spot, of which all the plowing and digging
in the neighborhood has left no trace.</p>

<p>What Calza found at Ostia was a coastguard station, or
<i>castrum</i>, planted by the Romans at the river’s mouth once
their control of the sea was established by their victory over
Antium’s navy (which produced the bronze beaks on the
Rostra). The normal complement of such a station was 300
men. A contingent of that size could have manned Ostia’s
<i>castrum</i> wall with one soldier every six feet. Thus the prime
motive of the founding was military, and the <i>castrum</i> plan
is like the familiar and standard plan of a Roman army
camp. But the civilian plan antedated the military: Polybius
in his description of the Roman camp of about 150 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> says
that it was planned <i>like a town</i> (<i>i.e.</i>, with a rectangular grid
like Marzabotto). And Ostia’s function must from the beginning,
or soon after, have been commercial as well as
military. Its site at the river mouth was as ideal for collecting
the customs as for guarding the coast. Grain from Egypt
and Sicily to feed Rome may from the earliest days have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
been landed here and stored in warehouses for later shipment
upriver by barge. At all events history records the
appointment as early as 267 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> of a special finance officer
or <i>quaestor</i> for Ostia, and Calza found the footings of warehouses
of Republican date. The terracotta revetments mentioned
above date from this period. The houses and shops
remained humble for seven generations, but those generations
saw the departure of many a fleet, and the arrival of
many a consignment of grain. An inscription dated in 171
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> marking the limits of public land in Ostia shows that
by then it had expanded far beyond the <i>castrum</i> walls. But
the story of Ostia’s development, her new wall under Sulla,
new theater under Augustus, new port under Claudius, new
garden apartment houses under Trajan, and the rest, belong
to later chapters.</p>

<p>In the last half of the fourth century Rome fought two
wars against the Samnites. Alba Fucens (<a href="#ip_4_3">Fig. 4.3</a>) in the
Abruzzi, one of her advanced bases in the Second Samnite
War, has been explored since 1949 by the Belgians. It lies
3315 feet above sea level, on the Via Valeria sixty-eight miles
east-northeast of Rome. (The sixty-eighth milestone of the
Valeria was found <i>in situ</i> inside the colony wall.) Alba’s
site dominates five valleys. The Latin colony of 6000 families
planted here in 303 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> assured Rome’s communications
on two sides of Samnium, eastward to the Adriatic and
southeastward through the Liris valley.</p>

(J. B. Ward Perkins, “Early Roman Towns in Italy,” Fig. 9)</div></div>

<p>The pride of Alba is its walls, nearly two miles of them,
surrounding the three hills on which the colony lies. The
material is limestone, which breaks at the quarry into irregular,
polygonal blocks. These are set without mortar.
The excavators distinguished four different building techniques
in the wall. They assumed that the roughest sectors,
built of enormous blocks, were the oldest, coeval with the
foundation of the colony. These polygonal walls, common
all over central Italy, used to be called Pelasgian or Cyclopean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
and were formerly assumed to be of immemorial
antiquity, but recent archaeological work has pushed the
dates of most of them down into the late fourth century or
later. At Alba the techniques involve the use of smaller
blocks and more careful workmanship in successive phases,
until finally with the use of cement we reach the 80’s <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
and the age of Sulla. On the northwest, where the hill has
the gentlest slope, the circuit is triple, and the outermost
is the latest. The loop to the north was the <i>arx</i>; it was destroyed
by an earthquake in 1915. The wall is pierced by
four gates, some with portcullis and bastions. The Via
Valeria entered at the northwest, made a right-angled turn,
passed the civic center, and emerged at the southeast; that
is, it was made to conform to a grid plan within the colony,
a grid plan laid down despite the hilly terrain, which made
terracing necessary.</p>

<p>Excavating Alba’s civic center, the Belgians found a
Forum, with altar and miniature temple, buried under
many feet of earth. They also found a basilica (a rectangular
roofed hall with nave and two side aisles, used as a law
court and commercial center), presenting its long side, with
three entrances, to a portico facing the Forum. Beside the
basilica, a market, with baths on one side and a temple on
the other, with early revetments, repeatedly restored. An
adjoining street, parallel to the Valeria, was lined with shops,
including a fuller’s drycleaning establishment and at least
one wine shop. The doorsills still show slots for the shutters.
In front of the shops ran a portico supported on high pilasters.
In the curb were holes where customers might tie their
mules. At the corner of the <i>decumanus</i>, the excavators
found charming statuettes of elephants, used as street signs.
Under the market were revealed subterranean chambers
accessible only by manholes; the excavators suggest that
these are the very dungeons, dark underground <i>oubliettes</i>,
where prisoners of state like King Syphax of Numidia in
203 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, King Perseus of Macedonia in 167, the Gallic chief<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Bituitus in 121 were incarcerated, for the Romans often
used their colonies as detention points.</p>

<p>Levels, construction techniques, and artifacts assigned
various dates to these buildings, but their earliest phases
fall in the Republican period, in the age of Sulla or earlier.
To the age of Sulla belongs also a handsome rock-cut theater.
There is an amphitheater of the early Empire; as we know
from a new inscription, its donor was Macro, the notorious
informer under the Emperor Tiberius, who brought about
the fall of the Emperor’s ambitious and scheming favorite,
Sejanus.</p>

<p>Walls, grid, civic center, public buildings: these made of
Alba a smaller and more orderly replica of Rome. The
general layout is repeated so often in so many places that
it suggests a master plan made in the censors’ office in
Rome. By the time Cosa was founded, in 273 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, the
Romans already could draw on the experience of founding
at least eighteen colonies.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Cosa, where the writer did his first excavating, may be
used to supply a little more detail on materials and methods
in field archaeology. Seven eight-week spring seasons of
excavation there (1948–1954), modestly intended as laboratory
training for young American classicists, have in fact
resulted in a remarkably complete picture of an old-style
Latin colony. The site was chosen for excavating because
it looked attractive from air photographs, because it was
convenient to Rome (ninety miles up the Via Aurelia on
the Tyrrhenian Sea), and because its walls were almost
perfectly preserved, great gray masses of polygonal limestone
looming up as high as a four-story building on a 370-foot
hill that rises out of the reclaimed swamplands of the
Tuscan Maremma. For Cosa was planted, carved out of
the territory of the once proud Etruscan city of Vulci, to
mount guard over Rome’s newly acquired marches, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
to affirm Rome’s name and supremacy in a restive neighborhood.</p>

<p>A large assortment of gear is necessary for a modern
scientific dig, even a modest one: for surveying and levelling,
clinometer (which measures slopes), plane-table (which
measures angles), alidade (which shows degree of arc),
prismatic compass with front and back sights (for taking
accurate bearings; the prism brings the object being sighted,
the hair-line of the front sight, and the reading on the compass
card all in a vertical line together), leveling staves
marked in centimeters (for measuring elevations); templates
for recording the curves of moldings; brooms, brushes, and
mason’s tools for cleaning the architectural finds; zinc plates
and sodium hydroxide pencils for electrolysis of coins;
measuring tapes of all sizes, mechanical drawing instruments,
trowels, marking-pegs, cord, squared paper, large sheets of
filter paper for taking “squeezes” of inscriptions, catalogue
cards, India ink, shellac, cardboard boxes, small cloth bags,
labels, journal books, field notebooks, and a small library of
technical manuals. The gear was divided between the villa
where the staff lived and an abandoned Italian anti-aircraft
observation post on the site itself, whose concrete gunmounts
made excellent drying floors for freshly washed potsherds.</p>

<p>Ambitious excavations use a light railway for carting earth
to the dump, but at Cosa, which ran on a shoestring budget
($5000 for eight weeks), the vehicle was the wheelbarrow,
the track a set of boards bound at the ends with iron to keep
them from splitting. Twenty of the local unemployed formed
the corps of workmen. The foreman, in better times a
master carpenter, used a pick with all the delicacy of a surgeon
with a scalpel.</p>

<p>The first step in excavating a site is to lay down a grid—fifty-meter
squares are convenient—marked with wooden
stakes set in cement and levelled. During the ten months of
the year when there was no digging and Cosa was abandoned
to the shepherds, they operated on the conviction that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
stakes marked the spot where the treasure lay buried. They
would overturn them and dig like badgers, and each new
season would have to begin with a partial re-survey.</p>

<p>A typical excavating day would begin with the removal
of surface earth in wheelbarrows. As large objects came to
light—bits of amphora, roof-tile, terracotta revetments—they
were placed in shallow yard-square wooden boxes
called <i>barrelle</i>, equipped fore and aft with carrying shafts,
and labelled accurately with the precise designation of the
area from which the finds came: Capitolium Exterior South,
Level I; Arx North Slope, Surface, and the like. Small objects—bone
<i>styli</i>, small sherds, loomweights (pierced terracotta
parallelepipeds, whose weight held the threads
hanging straight down on an ancient vertical loom), lamps,
fragments of inscriptions—went into separate marked cloth
bags. Thus the horizontal and vertical findspot of each
object was precisely known, so that when a dated or datable
object was found in a level, the whole level could be automatically
dated, and so the whole mosaic painstakingly put
together and the history of the site analyzed, or, as the
archaeologist says, “read.” The meanest potsherd, accurately
defining a context, thus becomes more valuable historically
than a whole museum shelf full of gold jewelry from an
unstratified dig.</p>

<p>When a <i>barrella</i> and a set of cardboard boxes had been
filled, they were carried to the excavation shack and sorted.
Objects that could not be “read”—shapeless bits of rubble,
parts of coarse pots without profile of base or rim—were
discarded, the rest sent to be washed. After washing and
drying, cataloguing began. Every object was painted with
a small square of shellac, on which its catalogue number was
written in India ink and then shellacked over to preserve it.
A letter indicated the dig, another the season, a number
showed the place of the object in the chronological sequence
of finds. A typical entry might read like the card, p. <a href="#card101">101</a>.
Leica or plate photographs were taken of all important finds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
and separately indexed for ready reference in the final
publication.</p>

<p>After the workmen’s day (7:00 <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span> to 4:30 <span class="smcap smaller">P.M.</span>, with a
half-hour for lunch) was over, there was still much for the
staff to do. Pottery, spread out on trestle tables, had to be
examined, joins made where possible, types distinguished.
(Careful attention at Cosa to plain Roman black glaze has
led to an arrangement of types in a dated series which will
be useful for future dating on other sites.) Evenings were
devoted to writing up the journal, studying the manuals,
making drawings, planning the next day’s dig, and shop
talk. The results of a typical season’s work, in 1950 on the
<i>arx</i> at Cosa (<a href="#ip_4_4">Fig. 4.4</a>), were to isolate a second temple at
right angles to the Capitolium, restore on paper the design
of several sets of terracotta revetments, follow the line of the
Via Sacra from the <i>arx</i> gate to the Capitolium, clear the <i>arx</i>
wall, get down to bedrock beside the Capitolium, discover
a terracotta warrior who was part of the pedimental sculpture
of an older temple under the excavation shack, and in
general get a pretty clear idea of the religious center of the
colony as it was, perhaps, in the time of the elder Cato, in
the early second century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span></span></p>

<p>In the two seasons preceding the discoveries on the <i>arx</i>
just described, much work had been done. In the survey to
set up the fifty-meter grid, Cosa’s own ancient rectangular
grid of streets, with pomerial street running just inside the
wall as at Marzabotto, came out clear enough to be plotted
on the plan (<a href="#ip_4_5">Fig. 4.5</a>), together with the standard blocks
of housing, like the identical “ribbon-development” apartment
blocks of a welfare state, which compensated the
pioneers for whatever fleshpots they had given up in the
metropolis or elsewhere. Housing was found to occupy
two-thirds of Cosa’s thirty-three acres, while public buildings
took just over twenty per cent, and streets the rest.
The site, which is waterless, was found to be honey-combed
with cisterns: over sixty-five were plotted. The mile-and-a-half
of walls, with their eighteen towers, spaced an
effective bowshot apart, had been closely examined. They
were found to be built with two faces and a rubble fill. The
outer face was handsomely finished, with tight mortarless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
joints, and sloped seven degrees back—this is called “batter”—from
the perpendicular; the inner face was left rough.
Potsherds of the Etrusco-Campanian style found in the rubble
fill were of a period matching Livy’s date of 273 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> for
the colony. It was clear that the walls, which show throughout
no difference in technique, were built all at one go, at
the time the colony was founded. Those impatient of the
Roman reputation for perfect engineering will be pleased
to know that the ancient craftsmen, when they came to
close the ring of the wall, found they had made an error
of from two to four Roman feet. (The Roman foot approximately
equals the English.) The three gates were examined,
and found to be of two rooms, with the main gate grooved
on its inner walls with slots for the rise and fall of the
portcullis, as at Alba. Bordering the roads leading from the
gates were tombs. The director of the excavations, by skindiving,
examined the outworks of the port, built to prevent
silting, and established them as Roman. They were parallel
jetties 350 feet long, supported on huge piers measuring
twenty by thirty Roman feet, and forty-five Roman feet
apart.<a id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">C</a></p>

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_C" href="#FNanchor_C" class="fnanchor">C</a> Undersea exploration, one of the most fascinating branches of archaeology,
has not been carried as far in Italy as in France (see, <i>e.g.</i>, P. Diolé,
<i>4,000 Years under the Sea</i> [New York, 1954]). But this is a convenient place
to report a 1950 Italian operation off Albenga, on the Ligurian coast between
Genoa and the French border. Along this stretch of the Italian Riviera
fishermen’s nets had frequently brought up amphorae, presumably from
an ancient wreck, which was soon located in twenty fathoms. The use of
an iron grab damaged the sunken hull, but an impressive number and variety
of objects were recovered. The ship yielded up over 700 more or less intact
cork-sealed, pitch-lined amphorae, from a cargo of perhaps thrice that number;
their shape was that current in the second and first centuries <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Some
had contained wine, others still held hazel-nuts. Campanian black-glaze pottery,
of a type datable in the last half of the second century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, was found
in sufficient quantity to enable Professor Nino Lamboglia, who was in charge
of the operation, to set up a whole typology of black-glaze ware, based on
types, fabric, and glaze, a typology which proved a useful check for dating
Cosan pottery, and for which the Cosan results have provided some corrections.
Lead pipes and lead sheathing resembled those found in the ships
from Lake Nemi (see Chapter 7), and a stone crucible with molten lead
in the bottom suggested that running repairs could be carried out at sea.
Fragments of three helmets, of unusual design, may have been intended
for Marius’ army, which was campaigning in the north against Germanic
tribes in the late second century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The finds are on display in the Albenga
Museum (see N. Lamboglia, “Il Museo Navale Romano di Albenga,” <i>Rivista
Ingauna e Intemilia</i> [1950] Nos. 3 and 4).</p></div>

<p>The 1949 campaign concentrated on the Capitolium
(<a href="#ip_4_6">Fig. 4.6</a>), situated so that its central <i>cella</i> lay over a cleft
in the rock, from which some kind of oracular fraud could
be perpetrated. Between porch and <i>cellae</i>, running the
width of the building, was a cistern lined with the waterproof
cement called <i>opus signinum</i>, made of lime, sand, and
pounded bits of terracotta. The temple walls, which stand
on the south to an impressive height, visible far out to sea,
were built of brick-like slabs of the local calcareous sandstone,
set in mortar. On the north, the line worn in the rock
by water dripping gives mute evidence of the wide overhang
of the roof, Etrusco-Italic style. Some of the terracotta
revetments belonged to the older, wooden temple. It must
have made a brave show when it was new, covered with
brightly painted tiles, its pediment and roof ornaments
glittering in the sun.</p>

<p>The last four campaigns of digging attacked the Forum
area, thickly overgrown with asphodel, acanthus, and thistles.
Here lay the remains of an ungainly but monumental triple
arch of about 150 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, the oldest dated arch in Italy. It had
a central roadway for wheeled traffic, two side arches for
pedestrians, and a stone bench attached to the outer face
where old men could sit in the sun and gossip. There was
a basilica, as big as a New England town hall, like Alba’s
(but older: about 180 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>). It presented its long side to the
Forum, had a nave and two side aisles, and a tribune for
the presiding judge at the back, with a vaulted cell, perhaps
the local lock-up, beneath it. At some time in the early
Empire the basilica was abandoned as a legal center, and
restored as a festival hall, or intimate theater.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
Other buildings turned out to hold fascinating secrets. A
complex beside the basilica turned out to be an Atrium
Publicum, a public hall in the form of the central unit of an
Italic house, which was rebuilt as an inn for the patrons of
the adjoining festival hall. When, about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 35 (on the evidence
of pottery—the “Arretine ware” characteristic of the
period), the basilica wall collapsed, it crushed and entombed
in place the inn’s complete furnishings and equipment. The
excavators suddenly found their hands full of tableware,
kitchen crockery, and all sorts of household gear, in metal,
glass, and stone; decorative pieces, including a lively marble
statuette of Marsyas; and objects of personal adornment,
including a fine engraved amethyst. For the first time outside
of Pompeii an ancient building had yielded not only its
structure but its contents.</p>

<p>On the other side of the basilica, excavation of what had
been called Building C brought further surprises. When the
workmen had stripped the surface humus off the area of the
forecourt, the excavators found themselves looking at a
perfect circle of dark earth enclosed by a sandy yellow fill.
Further digging established this as a circular, theater-like
structure, big enough to hold 600 people. There was an
altar in the middle. This must have been the Comitium,
the colony’s assembly-place (<a href="#ip_4_7">Fig. 4.7</a>). Building C, behind
it, must have been the Curia, or Senate House. The undisturbed
fill under the Curia floor proved completely sterile;
hence the curia must have been built at a date near the
foundation of the colony. At this stage both Curia and
Comitium were apparently of wood, replaced in a second
phase, before the end of the third century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, with purple
tufa from nearby Vulci.</p>

<p>A healthy site, an orderly plan, a water supply, strong
walls, housing, provision for political and religious needs:
the basic necessities are all here, at Cosa, and all as early as
the founding of the colony. By hard work, painstaking
accuracy, and intelligent inference, Brown and Richardson,
the excavators of Cosa, have given us the clearest possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
picture of the physical structure of a Roman colony well on
in the first intense period of history in the planting of advanced
bases. Cosa is clearly the fruit of long practice and
Etrusco-Italic tradition, untouched by Hellenism (no Greek
architectural language in sculptural or ornamental marble)
or by new-fangled techniques (no brick or concrete in the
early phases). When we carry down Cosa’s architectural
history to the early Empire, we infer the death of freedom
of speech from the remodelling of the basilica into a theater.
And when freedom of speech and public life died, the colony
lost its sense of community. Its thirty-three acres would
have held 3000 to 3500 settlers comfortably. But the first
draft of settlers numbered probably 2500 families. (We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
infer families, not soldiers only, from the discovery of loomweights,
hardly appropriate for Roman legionaries.) 2500
families make a population of at least 7500, and probably
more, given Italian philoprogenitiveness. Some of these must
have lived well outside the colony; only those whose centuriated
allotments, explained below, lay nearest the walls
would have lived in the colony proper. The holders of more
distant plots would come to town only for market, worship,
litigation (as long as the basilica lasted), or refuge from
raiding parties of Gauls or other enemies. And so, under
despotism, the community disintegrated. The temples held
on longest. “Only the gods, in the end,” writes Professor
Brown, “held steadfastly to their ancient seats.”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>By derivation, a <i>colonia</i> is a place where men till the soil.
Colonists were assigned centuriated allotments. Since traces
of centuriation have been found both at Alba Fucens and
at Cosa (Figs. <a href="#ip_4_8">4.8</a> and <a href="#ip_4_9">4.9</a>), as well as at nearly fifty other
certain and half as many possible sites in Italy, this seems
an appropriate place to discuss the subject. Wherever colonies
were planted, wherever land was captured, confiscated,
redistributed to the poor or to veterans, the surveyor
with his <i>groma</i>, or plane-table, was on hand. Air photography
is a great help in revealing traces of the Roman surveyor
at work, for modern land-use has often overlaid the
ancient traces, leaving ancient crop-marks as the only clue.
The standard surveyor’s unit was the <i>centuria</i> of 200 <i>iugera</i>
(the <i>iugerum</i>, five-eighths of an acre, being the area an
ox could plow in a day), and a side of twenty <i>actus</i> (776
yards), its corners marked by boundary stones, some of
which survive. There has been too little digging to confirm
the results of air reconnaissance, but it seems clear that
some centuriation goes back to the late third century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
Dr. Ferdinando Castagnoli, the Italian expert, is inclined
to date that of Alba and Cosa at least this early, as well
as large stretches in the fertile Campanian plain northwest
of Naples.</p>

<p>The surveyor liked to link up his centuriated grid with
a colony plan. Thus at Cosa the <i>groma</i>, for siting the allotments,
could have been set up in the Porta Romana (the
northeast gate), and at Alba the line of the Via Valeria
inside the walls, if projected, would cut the lines of centuriation
at right angles. The four sides of the <i>centuria</i>
were usually marked by roads, the inner subdivisions by
narrower roads, trees, hedges, or drainage or irrigation
ditches. Modern land-use often follows the line of the ancient:
one stretch recently laid out and now in use at Sesto,
west of Florence, deliberately follows the traces of Roman
centuriation, restored by a classically trained engineer for
modern man to admire. As with the grid inside a colony
wall, the centuriated grid of allotments was laid out from a
basic <i>cardo</i> and <i>decumanus</i>. The Roman surveyors were
balked by no natural barriers. Bradford cites one line of
centuriation running as high as 1600 feet above sea level<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
(though within the <i>centuriae</i> the furrows might follow the
contours) and another, in Dalmatia, continues from a peninsula
across to the mainland, spanning an arm of the Adriatic
Sea three miles wide. In north Italy, where the flatlands
of the Po Valley made the survey easy, one can ride from
Turin (Roman Augusta Taurinorum) to Trieste (Roman
Tergeste), three hundred miles, through centuriated systems
all the way. The same air photographs which revealed
neolithic sites to Bradford in Apulia showed Roman centuriation,
too, and subsequent digging turned up pottery
of Gracchan date (about 133–122 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>). A particularly extensive
stretch, outside of Italy, is found in Tunisia. It has
been traced from the air 175 miles from Bizerta to Sfax,
and southwestward from Cape Bon for 100 miles inland.
It probably goes back to ambitious plans of Gaius Gracchus,
about 122 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, to resettle Rome’s urban proletariat.</p>

Dozens of others remain to be explored, on hilltops and
headlands, by rivers and crossroads, the length and breadth
of Italy. Recent excavation at the Latin colony of Paestum,
on the coast fifty miles southeast of Naples, has traced the
Roman grid (<a href="#ip_4_10">Fig. 4.10</a>), identified yet another Comitium,
and produced over 1,000,000 small finds. And still other
colonial sites lie under populous modern towns and cities:
examples, in chronological order of planting, are Anzio,
Bimini, Benevento, Brindisi, Spoleto, Cremona, Piacenza,
Pozzuoli, Salerno, Vibo Valentia, Bologna, Pèsaro, Parma,
Modena, and Òsimo. Their foundation-dates span the years
from about 338 to 157 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, the expanding years of the
Roman Republic, the years of “Manifest Destiny.” Their
continued existence compliments the Roman founders’ nice
eye for a promising site, but makes large-scale investigation
of Roman levels difficult or impossible, for residents of
flourishing modern cities naturally resist resettlement in
the interests of archaeology. Excavation in these populated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
areas must wait upon repair of war damage, urban improvements
(as when laying new sewer mains reveals
Roman ones that follow the grid of the Roman streets), or
new building to bring new facts to light. No colony has
been completely excavated. At least forty per cent of ancient<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Ostia and Pompeii remains to be dug. But generations
of archaeologists of many nations have dealt patiently and
intelligently with the evidence. Perhaps, considering the
long span of two-and-a-half millennia since the earliest tradition
of the planting of Roman colonies, the wonder is
not that we know so little but that we know so much.</p>

<p>What archaeology has revealed is the story of the exploitation
of a frontier, with much that is exciting, and
much that is sordid. There are many points of resemblance
to the history of the American West, though two differences
should be emphasized: the Romans often planted
their outposts in the territory not of savages but of their
cultural equals, and the Roman frontier was settled not by
private but by government enterprise. But the likenesses
are striking. Centuriation produces something like quarter-sections;
land grants to veterans resemble grants under the
Homestead Act; the Roman grid town-plans were reproduced
in our Spanish settlements of the Southwest. And
perhaps, on the Roman as on the American frontier, the
atmosphere was less democratic than Frederick Jackson
Turner thought.</p>

<p>What archaeology digs up in the colonies is material remains,
brute facts, but what it infers is men; men marching
out in serried ranks under their standards for the formal
act of founding (<i>deductio</i>); Romans and local Italians living
side by side with some degree of amity and equality;
Romans impressing their ways and speech on the peoples
round about; Roman slum-dwellers given a new chance in
the new territory; large estates broken up to give land to
the landless; grizzled veterans settled in the quiet countryside
after a lifetime of hard campaigning; Romans homesick
in strange places; undergoing the rigors of frontier
existence; subject to the ferment of success and failure;
forging a cultural life (the epic poet Ennius, the dramatist
Pacuvius, the satirist Lucilius, all came from Roman colonies).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
The grid plans, in town and country, as Bradford has
pointed out, show, if not genius, then strong determination
and great powers of organization. The grids are, like the
Romans themselves, methodical, self-assured, technically
competent. They are also regimented, arbitrary, doctrinaire,
and opportunist. This was the price the Mediterranean
world had to pay for the security of the Roman peace.</p>

<p>But before that peace-without-freedom could be enjoyed,
the Roman Republic was to suffer its death throes. That
blood-bath was the work of the nabobs of the last century
before Christ, who left their stamp, as nabobs will, on the
buildings they erected to testify to their glory.</p>

<span class="subhead">Nabobs as Builders: Sulla, Pompey, Caesar</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The aftermath of Sulla’s second march on Rome in 83 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
was a spate of political murders and confiscations. The
profits were enormous, and Sulla used them for the most
ambitious building program in the history of the Republic.
His motive was in part the desire to rival what he had
seen in the cities of the Greek East, in part his understanding
that massive building projects are the outward and
visible sign of princely power. And so he monumentalized
the same Forum in which he displayed the severed heads
of his enemies, planning, in the Tabularium, or Records
Office, a theatrical backdrop for the tragedy which in the
ensuing years was to be played below. He settled 100,000
of his veterans in colonies in central and south Italy. He
built or reinforced walls in Rome, Ostia, and Alba Fucens;
theaters in Pompeii, Alba, Bovianum Vetus, and Faesulae;
he built temples in Tibur, Cora, Tarracina, Pompeii and
Paestum. And this is only a sample of his prodigious building
activity. But by all odds the most grandiose of his
completed projects took shape at Praeneste (nowadays
Palestrina), a little over twenty miles east of Rome, where
he sacked the town to punish it for taking the side of his
enemy Marius. He then built or restored there the great,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
axially-symmetrical, terraced Sanctuary of Fortune, the most
splendid monument in Italy of the Roman Republic.</p>

<p>In 1944 allied bombing sheared off the houses from the
steep south-facing slope where the medieval and modern
town was built, and revealed the plan of the Sanctuary.
Now, after fourteen years of excavation and restoring (reinforcement
with steel beams, injecting liquid concrete, loving
reproduction of the craft of ancient masons), the plan
is clearer than it has been at any time since antiquity. The
finds are displayed to advantage in the Barberini Palace
at the top of the Sanctuary, splendidly reconstructed as a
museum. The site repays a visit perhaps more than any
other in Latium.</p>

<p>The archaeological zone of Palestrina falls into an upper
and a lower part. In the lower area exciting discoveries
were made in 1958. Its southernmost retaining wall, and
the monumental ramped entrance, the Propylaea—enlivened
in antiquity with jets of water playing—was cleared. Between
it and the buildings of the lower zone, excavation
seventy years before had shown traces of pools and shaded
porticoes. In 1958, also, the façade was removed from the
cathedral in the center of the lower zone, revealing behind
it an imposing Roman temple with a lofty arched entrance,
its <i>cella</i> corresponding to the forward (south) part of the
nave of the present church. To the left rear (northwest)
of this temple was a natural cave, long known as the Antro
delle Sorti, where, according to time-honored local lore, the
lots were cast which gave this sanctuary of Luck its fame.
The cave, the excavators discovered, had been monumentalized
into the apse of a building (not shown in the plan),
its floor paved with a mosaic representing the sea off Alexandria.
The mosaic was sunk a couple of inches below
floor level and sloped forward to allow a thin film of water
to play over it, which brightens the colors and makes the
mosaic fish extraordinarily realistic. The mosaic also portrays
architectural elements—an altar, column, and capital—in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
what corresponds to the so-called Second Style at
Pompeii, dated in the first half of the first century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Opposite this building in the plan is another with a
grotto much like the natural cave on the left. It was from
this apse, again at a level a couple of inches below the
rest of the floor, that the famous Barberini mosaic (<a href="#ip_5_1">Fig. 5.1</a>)
came, a late Hellenistic copy of an original of the early
Ptolemaic age in Egypt. It is now handsomely restored and
displayed in the museum at the top of the Upper Sanctuary.
The mosaic combines a zoological picture-book of the
Egyptian Sudan—its real and fabulous monsters labelled
in Greek—with a spirited scene of the Nile in flood, with
farm-house, dove cote, a shipload of soldiers, crocodiles,
hippopotamuses, an elegant awninged pavilion, a towered
villa in a garden, a group of soldiers feasting in mixed
company (after them, the deluge), more wine, women
and song in an arbor nearby, behind the pavilion a temple
with statues of Egyptian gods in front, before them a man
riding, his servant following afoot with baggage; behind
the arbor a straw hut, with ibises in flight above it; in the
flood waters, canoes (one loaded with lotus blossoms) and
two large Nile river craft with curving prows—altogether
the most spirited essay which has come down to us in
the art of the mosaic. Interest in Egypt is a striking feature
of both Pompeian and Roman wall-painting of the last
half-century of the Republic and the early Empire. Examples
are the scene from Pompeii of pygmies fighting a
rhinoceros and a crocodile, now in the Naples Museum,
the cult scenes from the Hall of Isis under the Flavian
Palace on the Palatine, and the frescoes of the Pharaoh
Bocchoris in the Terme Museum from the villa under the
Farnesina. Alexandria was then the intellectual and artistic
capital of the world. The Lucullus who founded the Sullan
colony at Praeneste appears from an inscription found in
the lower area to be not the famous <i>bon vivant</i> (who had
been in Alexandria, the first foreign general ever to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
entertained by a Ptolemy in the palace) but his brother
Marcus. Nevertheless the two brothers were very close,
and the more famous of them may have supplied the mosaic,
the mosaic-maker, or the idea of using Egyptian motifs.</p>

<p>M. Lucullus’ name was carved on a fallen epistyle, a
marble block intended to connect two columns. Where did
the block belong? Gullini, the excavator, connected it with
a building which ran between the two apsidal halls in the
lower area. What survives is a back wall, built in the technique
called <i>opus incertum</i>, a strong lime and rubble wall,
studded externally with fist-sized stones of irregular shape.
This technique was standard in the age of Sulla. The wall
was decorated at regular intervals with two stories of half-columns,
ingeniously combining function with decoration:
they mask drainage conduits. The pavement in front of the
wall shows the marks of two column-bases in two different
rows, enough to justify restoring on paper a whole forest
of twenty-four columns. Two dimensions are known: the
diameter of the bases and the height of the half-columns
on the wall behind. Their proportionate relation is appropriate
to Corinthian columns, and some Corinthian capitals
of a size to fit were found in the area. Working from these
finds, the architect Fasolo could restore on paper a two-story
basilica (<a href="#ip_5_2">Fig. 5.2</a>, bottom) between the two apsidal
halls (only one hall is shown in the reconstruction). The
basilica is on a higher level than the newly-isolated temple
to the south of it. The difference in level is made most
clearly visible by sets of superimposed columns on the
southwest side of the basilica (where the lower columns are
below the basilica pavement level), by the pavement below
the <i>piazza</i> of the modern town, and in the façade of the
right-hand (eastern) apsidal hall, which is in <i>opus incertum</i>,
while its lower level, the colony’s <i>aerarium</i> or treasury,
heavily built of tufa blocks, had the difference in construction
hidden by a portico with Doric columns.</p>

The terrace marking the transition between the lower
area and the Upper Sanctuary used to be covered by houses
and shops, all damaged or destroyed by the 1944 bombing.
When the debris was cleared away, it was found that the
modern buildings had rested on a two-level terrace (I and
II in the reconstruction), and had backed against and
protected from centuries of weathering 325 magnificent
feet of polygonal wall. The wall gives an architectonic front
to the cliff and is at the same time functional. Its top was
the architect’s base line; on it he built his complex, a splendid
series of superimposed terraces, which, now that the
rubble from the bombing has been cleared away, is revealed
in all its magnificence, of ramps (III), Hemicycle Terrace
(IV), Terrace of Arches with Half-columns (V), and Cortina
Terrace (VI), all leading up to the final stepped hemicycle
(VII) with the circular <i>tholos</i> for the cult statue at
the very top. A draped torso in blue Rhodian marble (now
in the museum), of a size to fit the <i>tholos</i>—whose dimensions
are preserved in the fabric of the Barberini Palace—may
be the cult statue of the goddess Fortune: Lady Luck
herself.</p>

<p>The next level is approached by a pair of imposing ramps
running east and west, converging on an axis. Fasolo and
Gullini found that the ramps were supported by a series
of concrete vaults, concealed, all but one, by a facing of
<i>opus incertum</i> (see p. <a href="#Page_120">120</a>). The exception is the central
vault, which was left open, lined with waterproof concrete,
and made into a fountain-house. The terrace in front
of the ramps is beautifully paved with polygonal blocks.
A room—perhaps priests’ quarters—at the bottom of the left
ramp is decorated in the Pompeian First Style—embossed
polychrome squares, red, buff, and green, with dado.
Houses at Pompeii thus decorated are dated between 150
and 80 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, so that this decoration accords with a Sullan
date. The decorated room is paved with waterproof cement
with bits of white limestone imbedded in it. The technique,
called <i>lithostroton</i>, was in vogue in Sulla’s time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
On the ramps were found three curious column capitals,
which at first puzzled the excavators, and then gave the
clue to the whole complex on top of the ramps. What is
odd about the capitals is that they incline (<a href="#ip_5_3">Fig. 5.3</a>) twenty-two
degrees with respect to the axis of the columns. Since
this slant corresponds to the grade of the ramp, the columns
must have been intended to bear an inclined architrave or
beam of stone. This poses a difficult problem in statics;
that Sulla’s architect solved it is the wonder of his modern
successors. The roadway up the ramp shows, on the outboard
(south) side of a drain running up its middle, a
stylobate (course of masonry on which columns rested)
with cuttings for column bases. Reading these stones, Fasolo
and Gullini concluded that the outboard half of the roadway
up the ramp was roofed, while the inboard half was
open to the sky. On the extreme outboard edge of the roadway
are preserved the remains, about a yard high, of a wall
in <i>opus incertum</i>, with the bottoms of half-columns, their
fluting laid on in stucco, mortised into it at intervals corresponding
to the cuttings in the stylobate. The half-round
profile at the bottom of the wall suggests projecting the
same profile all the way up. This involves restoring a blank
windowless wall (windows would make it too weak to
bear the weight of the roof) closing the entire south side
of the porticoed roadway, blocking the breath-taking view
across Latium to the sea, and forcing the eye upward to
the top of the ramp. Architectural members designed to
be clamped together in pairs, of a size to fit the tops of
the inclined capitals, gave the answer to the question how
the portico was roofed. One of the pairs supported a barrel
vault, the other a vertical masonry wall designed to mask
the spring of the vault. Other architectural members, with
an oblique chamfer, found at the top and the bottom of
the ramp, suggest that the ends of the vaults were masked
with a pediment or gable end, and therefore that the whole
vault was covered with a pitch roof. The two ramps debouch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
at the top in an open space paved in herringbone brick,
a sort of balcony with—at last—a splendid view southward.
To the north a stair led to the next level, the level of the
Hemicycle Terrace.</p>

<p>The Hemicycle Terrace (IV) is planned, Fasolo and
Gullini discovered, symmetrically to the axis of the whole
composition, at this level marked by a central stair which
has suffered a good deal from having had a modern house
built on top of it. One can make out, however, that the
stair was narrowed at one point (where there may have
been a gate) by fountain niches on either side. The play
of water is important at every level of the Sanctuary. Under
the stair passes a vaulted corridor connecting the two axially
symmetrical halves of the terrace. Closest to the stair on
each side are four arches; beyond these, the monumental
hemicycles which are the architectonic center of each wing.
They have vaulted, coffered ceilings, and a concentric colonnade
with Ionic-Italic (four-voluted) columns. Before they
were restored, these were badly corroded, and covered
with verdigris from the acid of the coppersmith’s shop which
occupied the spot before the bombing. The epistyle carries
an inscription, almost illegible, but apparently referring to
building and restoring done on the initiative of the local
Senate, presumably after the Sullan sack. The outer surface
or extrados of the vaults is concealed—as it was on
the porticoed ramp—by a story called an attic, in <i>opus
incertum</i>, divided into rectangular panels by engaged columns
with semicircular drums in tufa. At the back of each
hemicycle runs a platform approached by two steps, with
consoles on which planks could be placed to make more
room; this suggests that it was intended for spectators to
stand on. The pavement, as in the room at the foot of the
ramp, is <i>lithostroton</i>; the likeness in the paving justifies the
inference that the two terraces (III and IV) were built
about the same time. On the far side of each hemicycle
are four more arches. In front of the right-hand (eastern)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
hemicycle is a wishing well, with footings round it from
which Fasolo and Gullini have been able to restore to the
last detail, with the help of some architectural fragments,
a small round well-house, with a high grille above its
balustrade, now to be seen in the museum. Coins found
in the well, whose heaviest concentration is in the mid-second
century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, suggest that the well-house is much
later in date than the terrace on which it stands. But the
well-house stands on the central terrace of seven; it may
have been the spot where, in the early days of the Sanctuary,
the lots were cast. From either end of the Hemicycle
Terrace ramps (<a href="#ip_5_4">Fig. 5.4</a>) ascended to the Cortina Terrace
(VI), the next but one above.</p>

Terrace. (H. Kähler, <i>Ann. Univ. Saraviensis</i> 7 [1958], Pl. 39)</p></div></div>

<p>The stair which divides the Hemicycle Terrace leads to
the Terrace of the Arches with Half-columns (V), also
symmetrically planned on the axis of the stair. There are
nine deep arches on either side of the stair. Possibly these
were stalls for the various guilds—wine merchants, wagoners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
cooks, weavers, garland-makers, second-hand dealers,
money-changers—who, as we know from inscriptions, made
dedications to Fortune, and had a financial interest in her
Sanctuary. Here again close observation has enabled the
excavators to tell exactly how the façade of this terrace
looked when it was new. The even-numbered arches are
narrower and lower than the odd-numbered ones, are left
rough within, and are floored with a pebble fill, from all
of which it is inferred that they were not meant to be
seen. Sills found <i>in situ</i>, and uprights, cornices, and volutes,
found on the Hemicycle Terrace, where they do not fit into
the architecture, and therefore must have fallen from above,
can be restored as blind doors set in the walls which closed
the even-numbered arches. Small travertine panels, with
a molded surround, and a cornice above, found on this
terrace, will have been set into the wall on either side of
the blind doors, at lintel level. The same decorative motif
was found in place on the back wall of the basilica area
in the lower zone. The repetition of motif makes an aesthetic
link between the two levels. The odd-numbered arches are
mosaic-paved and plastered, and were therefore meant to
be visible. Enough remains in place to show that the profile
of the arch was set with tufa blocks supported on
pilasters. These alternating open arches framed with pilasters
and closed arches with blind doors all supported
an epistyle and cornice which in turn supported the parapet
of the Cortina Terrace above.</p>

<p>The Cortina Terrace (VI), nearly 400 feet deep, was a
hollow square, open to the south except for a balustrade,
closed to the east and west by a three-columned portico,
connected at the back (north) with a <i>lithostroton</i>-paved
vaulted corridor, called a cryptoporticus, which runs under
the stair to the semicircular Terrace VII. Again, similarity
of plan and décor ties the whole ensemble together. (Nowadays,
the approach to Terrace VII is by a double-access
stair, but this is of the seventeenth century.) At the back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
of the terrace, six arches, three on either side of the central
stair, gave access to the cryptoporticus. At either end of
the three-arch sequence is an arched projecting fountain
house in appearance not unlike a Roman triumphal arch,
with a pair of narrow windows in its back wall, opening
on the cryptoporticus. Heavy deposits of lime on the back
wall suggest an arrangement whereby persons passing
through the cryptoporticus could look out through a thin
sheet of water onto the Cortina Terrace. Enough traces
remain to restore on paper the three-columned portico on
the east and west. It was roofed with a pair of barrel vaults,
coffered like the ones in the hemicycles of Terrace IV
(another aesthetic link), and roofed like the great east-west
ramps which connect Terraces III and IV. The portico’s
outer walls were buttressed, and the north-south ramps
from the Hemicycle Terrace also helped to counter the
outward thrust.</p>

<p>And so we come to the exedra, the seventh of the superimposed
terrace levels, a most holy place, where the priests
could appear and offer sacrifice on an altar in full view
of the faithful assembled on the semicircular steps. At
the top of the exedra there now rises the splendid semicircle
of the Barberini Palace, but plate glass let into the
museum’s ground floor paving shows the tufa footings of
a semicircular series of columns, which must have been
the middle set of another double portico answering to the
one on the Cortina Terrace below, and, like it, double-barrel-vaulted
and pitch-roofed, but of course semicircular
in plan instead of U-shaped. Access to the porticoes was
not on the central axis of the whole complex, but by a
short narrow stair at either end of the exedra. (We shall
see how Hadrian, too, centuries later, liked these split-access
arrangements.) But, though there is no direct approach,
the distance between the columns on either side
of the main axis is extra-wide, to give a better view of the
circular building (<i>tholos</i>) above and behind, the culminating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
point of the whole plan, where the cult statue was
placed.</p>

<p>(J. Felbermeyer photo)</p></div></div>

<p>Such is the careful plan of the complex, justifying this
detailed treatment because it is a turning point in the history
of Roman architecture, perhaps the most seminal
architectural complex in the whole Roman world. Everything
(<a href="#ip_5_5">Fig. 5.5</a>) centers on an axis, everything rises, aspires
to the apex at the cult-statue, embracing a superb and at
each level more extensive view of the plain stretching away
southward to the sea. The materials and technique with
which this form is realized and supported are interesting
in themselves and for what they contribute to the dating
of the Sanctuary. The basic materials are tufa, limestone,
and concrete; no marble is used except in statuary. Limestone,
which in Roman architecture comes to predominance
later than tufa, is used for the facing of polygonal walls and
<i>opus incertum</i>, for décor (<i>e.g.</i>, the Corinthian capitals of
tufa columns), for pavements. The limestone spalls or chips
left over from the facing of <i>opus incertum</i> were used in
concrete cores and for fill. Tufa is used for footings, structure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
in squared blocks (<i>e.g.</i>, caissons for concrete), the
voussoirs, or wedge-shaped blocks, of arches, column drums,
the core of stuccoed decorative elements, cornices, corners.
Both materials are subordinate to concrete.</p>

<p>The use of concrete at Palestrina amounts to an architectural
revolution, and, as often, the revolution in taste
is combined with a revolution in materials and methods.
This strong, cheap, immensely tough material enabled the
architect to enclose space in any shape; henceforward architects
could concentrate on interiors, and the day of the
box-like temple was over. The architectural history that
culminates in the Pantheon begins here. The architect was
clearly more expert in the use of concrete than in the use
of stone. Palestrina concrete is hydraulic, a combination of
limestone chips and mortar made of <i>pozzolana</i> (volcanic
sand) and lime. Concrete footings, Fasolo and Gullini
found, go down to bedrock everywhere; <i>e.g.</i>, each of the
three rows of columns of the Cortina Terrace portico rests
on a foundation wall of concrete based on bedrock, while
the space between is hollow, to relieve weight. For the
same reason the whole hollow square of the Cortina Terrace
rests on a series of rectangular concrete coffers with
a stone fill. The result of this use of concrete is that the
whole Upper Sanctuary is structurally a single unit. Each
level is planned as a step toward, and a retaining wall of,
the level next above. The stresses, Fasolo reports, are never
more than about three pounds per square yard for walls
and eight pounds per square yard for columns; this in a
structure which is in effect a skyscraper 400 feet high.
There is repetition of motif throughout, not from paucity
of imagination, or because it is the easy way, but of set
aesthetic purpose, to emphasize the concealed structural
unity and to use the functional parts of the complex to give
architectonic unity to the whole. Thus the upper hemicycle
stair repeats the two hemicycles of the lower terrace,
and the relation between them is a triangle, which repeats<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
in a different plane the triangle of the double converging
ramp. The arches are treated as beams to bear the weight
of stone construction, and the stone construction is a caisson
for the concrete.</p>

<p>Fasolo and Gullini argue ingeniously for a date earlier
than Sulla for the Sanctuary, but their arguments have not
found general favor. The most that can be said is that certain
inscriptions mentioning restoration, reconstruction, or dedications
to Fortune earlier than 80 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> imply a previously
existing and probably much simpler structure, centering on
the east half of the Hemicycle Terrace, but nothing in the
technique or materials now visible or inferred requires
other than a Sullan date for any part of the Sanctuary.</p>

<p>In materials and methods, in massiveness and axial symmetry,
the Sanctuary of Fortune bears a Roman stamp.
But when we recall the experience of Sulla and his lieutenants,
the Luculli, in the Creek East, Greek influence
is very likely. Of the many Hellenistic Greek complexes
available for comparison, the closest in spirit to Palestrina
is the Sanctuary of Asclepius on the island of Kos in the
Dodacanese, in the southeast Aegean Sea, where the major
temple, built in the mid-second century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, is the focal
point of a grandiose composition (<a href="#ip_5_6">Fig. 5.6</a>). Placed on the
highest of three terraces, it is framed by a three-sided colonnade
like the Cortina Terrace at Palestrina, and approached
by three successive monumental stairways leading up the
lower terraces, which are arched as at Palestrina. A few
standard architectural ingredients, arches, colonnades, monumental
stairways, are grouped as a clearly defined composition,
easy to grasp, simple, bold, plastic, the few standard
elements firmly juxtaposed. Contrasts of scale, an elevated
and central position, an axial approach, all make of the
temple the focal, culminating point of the composition. It
is exactly so at Palestrina, and in scores of other Hellenistic
sanctuaries. Also noteworthy in both places is “the same
outspoken taste for vista. Not only is the triple-terraced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
sanctuary visible from afar, not only is the crowning element,
a temple, a beacon toward which visitor and worshipper
alike are drawn by the now familiar devices of
setting, frontality and access, but again, once we have
reached the summit, a scene of breathtaking beauty, of
unexpected amplitude, of mountain, sea and plain confronts
us.” The words are those of Phyllis Lehmann, from whom
the description of the site at Kos draws heavily, but they
were reinforced by a visit made by the present writer to
the island in September, 1956, expressly to compare the
site with Palestrina. Mrs. Lehmann goes on, “Although
many factors, notably the sanctity of a cult spot, were involved
in the choice of such sites, their architectural treatment
attests a keen awareness of landscape setting as a
prime aesthetic ingredient in the total effect.” The unknown
architect-genius who planned Palestrina probably knew the
Greek Sanctuary at Kos; he was certainly in touch with
the main movement of mind of his age. But the final impression
of this dynamic, utterly functional, axially symmetric
complex is not Greek but Roman, a great memorial
façade to celebrate the end of a Civil War. Italy as well
as Greece can provide ground-plans by which parts of the
Sanctuary at Palestrina might have been inspired, notably
one in Cagliari in Sardinia, and another at Gabii, near Rome.</p>

<p>(F. Fasolo and G. Gullini, <i>Il Santuario di Fortuna Primigenia</i>, Pl. 25)</p></div></div>

<p>This Roman classical masterpiece has, then, ancestors;
what about its descendants? They are many: from the
Sanctuary of Fortune contemporary and later architects
learned much. An example of this influence is the Temple
of Jupiter Anxur at Tarracina, above the Via Appia where
it touches the coast sixty-seven miles south of Rome. Here
the use of concrete, of <i>opus incertum</i>, of arch and vault,
of setting and landscape, is in the unmistakable idiom of
Sulla’s architect. It is an architectural complex and a seascape
which mediates, as Palestrina does, between man
and nature. It is designed to capture attention from the
colony below, to become more impressive as one approaches,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
and to give a gradually widening view of the sea as one
ascends. The temple was oriented north and south, with
a portico behind (<a href="#ip_5_8">Fig. 5.8</a>). It is set at an angle upon a
tremendous concrete podium, with arched cryptoporticus as
at Palestrina. On the seaward side the play of light and
shadow on the podium arches is enormously impressive;
on the side toward Sperlonga the sturdy blind buttress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
arches are again strongly reminiscent of what we have seen
on the Terrace of the Half-columns. Within the cryptoporticus
(the vaults under the Temple platform) the play
of light and shadow is again very satisfying, and yet the
structure is functional as well: the cryptoporticus lightens
the huge weight of the concrete, and the sturdy concrete
construction has stood the test of time.</p>

<p>Another Sullan descendant is the Tabularium (Public
Records Office) in Rome (<a href="#ip_5_9">Fig. 5.9</a>), finished in 78 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> by
Quintus Lutatius Catulus, to whom Sulla’s veterans transferred
their allegiance after Sulla’s death. It was a part of
Sulla’s plan for monumentalizing the Forum, to provide,
as it were, a scenic backdrop for it, which serves at the
same time as a terrace-level to give order to the Capitoline
Hill above. Its plan, its frontality, and its use of arch, vault
and concrete is in the Palestrina tradition. There is a cryptoporticus
in concrete, fronted by arches framed in half-columns
placed at points in the wall which required extra
strength. The upper levels of the Tabularium were removed
by Michelangelo when he designed the Palazzo del Senatore,
Rome’s city hall. Perhaps this may be taken as a
symbol of the extent and the limits of the influence of
Palestrina’s architect on Renaissance masters. One archeologist,
Heinz Kähler, has argued, ingeniously but without
carrying conviction, for an influence of the Cortina Terrace
and the exedra above it upon the design of Pompey’s
theater in Rome: one nabob borrowing architectural effects
from another.</p>

<p>Finally, about the time of Cicero’s consulship (63 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>),
Palestrina influenced the Sanctuary of Hercules Victor at
Tivoli, well-known to many from Piranesi’s etching as the
Villa of Maecenas. Like Kos and Palestrina (Cortina Terrace),
it had a portico on three sides, and a temple against
the back wall. Nowadays it houses a paper-mill, but forty
years ago the portico was uncluttered. There was an approach
by ramp and semicircular stair (<a href="#ip_5_10">Fig. 5.10</a>), very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
theatrical, like Palestrina and the Tabularium; the material
is again concrete faced with <i>opus incertum</i>. The podium is
again supported on concrete vaults, and lightened by a
complicated arrangement of subterranean rooms. A vast
cryptoporticus pierces the whole podium to carry the Via
Tiburtina, the main road from Rome to Tivoli. The famous
terraced gardens of the Villa d’Este nearby, with their plays
of water, felt the inspiration of Palestrina; their architect,
Pirro Ligorio, has left sketches of our site made by him
on the spot. Pietro da Cortona, Bramante, Raphael, Palladio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
and Bernini also knew and sketched Palestrina. Another
successful terrace plan inspired by Palestrina is Valadier’s
treatment in the 19th century of the steep slope up
the Pincio from the Piazza del Popolo in Rome.</p>

<p>Palestrina inspired the architects of the Roman Empire,
too: for example—one among many—it influenced to some
extent (see also p. <a href="#Page_267">267</a>) the architect of Trajan’s Market
in Rome, who uses terracing, concrete, and framed arches
(but the arches are flat, the framing is pilasters instead of
half-columns, and the façade is brick instead of <i>opus incertum</i>.)
The inspiration does not stop here: it is to be
found on the Palatine, in Hadrian’s villa near Tivoli, Diocletian’s
Baths in Rome, and his palace at Spalato, and the
Basilica of Maxentius in the Roman Forum.</p>

<p>From his building, from which the history of Roman
architecture really begins, we can reconstruct the personality
of the architect. It makes the whole history of Roman
architecture come alive, when we really know one complex.
The architect was a master of the manipulation of
surface, of light and shade, of counterthrust, controlled
views, the unitary plan, of space both full and empty. For
him, organic function is also decorative; the stylistic fact
is the constructive solution; his organization is clear, his
use of the classical “orders” of Graeco-Roman architecture,
Tuscan and Ionic, in stone as bearing walls is classical in
its combination of beauty and function. The plan of his
Sanctuary imposed itself as well on the secular plan of the
colony below. He is a real genius, one of the greatest architects
of all time. He achieves his magnificent results by
creative imitation of earlier models, and in this he is Roman.
Because his imitation is creative, it does not peter out in
formalism, but has a seminal effect upon other architects
of the Republic, the Empire, the Renaissance. A detailed
study of his masterpiece not only leaves us profoundly impressed
with the patience, thoroughness and imagination
of Italian archaeologists; it reinforces again the lesson of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the continuity of history and the cultural importance for
the whole western world of the Roman Republic.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Sulla went into voluntary retirement and—a rare achievement
in his time—died in bed. The next nabob to equal him
in stature, violence, and unconstitutionality was a man who
had begun his career as Sulla’s lieutenant, Pompey the
Great. Victories in Sicily and Africa, against slaves, pirates,
and Mithridates, brought him enormous spoils; he too
turned his mind to buildings to monumentalize his glory.
The result was Rome’s first stone theater, in the Campus
Martius, dedicated in his third consulship (52 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) but begun
in his second (55 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), in a great show involving 500
lions and seventeen to twenty elephants. What survives
of it is little more than a curve in a Roman street, some
blocks of tufa beneath a Roman square, and a memory.
Beneath the curve of the Via di Grotta Pinta, which
perpetuates the outline of its <i>cavea</i>, one may visit today,
in the lower regions of a Roman restaurant, the underpinnings
of the great building, which once held 12,000
spectators. The technique of these vaults, a development
of <i>incertum</i> called <i>opus reticulatum</i>, involves setting pyramidal
bricks, point inward, in a lozenge pattern into
a cement core. But though the entire superstructure has
disappeared, an ancient plan survives. In the late second
century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> the Emperor Septimius Severus caused to be
placed on the wall of the library in Vespasian’s Forum of
Peace a marble Plan of Rome, the <i>Forma Urbis</i>, which has
come down to us in over 1000 fragments. The ingenuity
with which these have been pieced together (work still
going on in 1959) would make a story in itself, but for
our present purpose only four fragments (<a href="#ip_5_11">Fig. 5.11</a>) are
relevant. The two parallel walls to the right (which is west;
north is at the bottom) give a fascinating insight into the
puritanical Roman mind at work. Straitlaced Romans objected
to theaters as immoral. Pompey’s architect therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
designed at the top of the theater’s <i>cavea</i> a temple of Venus
Victrix, represented by the two parallel walls in the plan.
The theater seats might then pass as a hemicycle approach
to a temple (compare the hemicycle approach to the
<i>tholos</i> at Palestrina). Puritanism was appeased.</p>

<p>Behind the stage the marble plan shows a great rectangular
portico, with a double garden-plot in the middle,
where we may restore in imagination trees planted, fountains
playing, and works of art displayed. At a Senate meeting
in a building associated with the portico, on the Ides
of March, 44 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, Caesar fell at the base of Pompey’s
statue, pierced by twenty-three daggers. What may be the
tufa blocks of this very building are visible today through
a sheet of plate glass in a pedestrian underpass in the Largo
Argentina. (Temples A and B of the Largo Argentina appear
to the left in the plan.)</p>

<p>Caesar was a greater man than Pompey. His spoils of
victory, after eight years in Gaul, were richer, and so was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
his building program. The most impressive surviving evidence
of it is the ground plan of his basilica, the Basilica
Julia in the Republican Forum, and, north of the old Forum,
which Rome and his own grandeur had outgrown, a grandiose
new one, the prototype of an Imperial series.</p>

<p>The Basilica Julia was planned and executed at Caesar’s
direction between 54 and 46 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, to balance the second-century
Basilica Aemilia opposite. All that remains is pavement
and piers, but the size of the piers is enough to show
that the building had two stories, presumably with a balcony
to afford a view of spectacles in the open space of
the Forum below. Time and man have dealt harshly with
the basilica. When it was excavated, in the 1840’s, a medieval
limekiln was found on the pavement. This, plus the
knowledge that its stone was sold by the oxcart load in
the Middle Ages for the benefit of a hospital which rose
on the site, explains what happened to the superstructure.
Scratched on the pavement are rough sketches, done by
ancient idlers, of statues which once adorned the building
or the Forum adjacent, and over eighty “gaming-boards,”
scratched circles divided into six segments on which dice
were thrown and counters moved. Lawyers’ speeches apparently
did not always hold the full attention of the Forum
hangers-on.</p>

<p>Caesar’s Forum has left more impressive remains. It cost
him a fortune, since his enemies, owners of the expropriated
houses, charged him 100,000,000 sesterces, five million
uninflated dollars, for the land. Its excavation was begun
in 1930, and finished in three years, by Corrado Ricci, as
a part of Mussolini’s (<a href="#ip_5_12">Fig. 5.12</a>) grandiose plan for systematizing
the center of the city and restoring the ancient
dictator’s Forum to set off a modern dictator’s monument,
a new street, the Via dell’ Impero, driven through slums
and ancient monuments to connect the Coliseum with his
headquarters in the Palazzo Venezia. The excavation exposed
the southern two-thirds of Caesar’s Forum; the rest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
lies under the new street. The Forum as revealed by Ricci
is another example of axial symmetry (<a href="#ip_5_13">Fig. 5.13</a>), a narrow
porticoed rectangle, over twice as long as it was wide, with
a temple set in the Italic fashion on a high podium at the
back. Working with great patience and delicacy, Ricci set
up three of the temple’s fallen columns (<a href="#ip_5_14">Fig. 5.14</a>), with
their architrave, frieze, and cornice. Some of the architectural
blocks leave between the dentils—a row of projecting
tooth-like rectangular members below the cornice—two
small distinctive marble disks side by side like a pair
of spectacles. This is the “signature” of Domitian’s architect
Rabirius, and prove that a restoration of the temple
was planned during his reign (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 81–96). There are Cupids
in the interior frieze, which prove that the temple was
dedicated to Venus, Caesar’s ancestor. To have gods for
ancestors lent distinction to a Roman clan, though Caesar
knew as well as any skeptic what it really meant. He knew
his pedigree back to an ever-so-great grandfather, and God
knew who <i>his</i> ancestor was. In the <i>gens Iulia</i> the line was
traced back to Iulus the son of Aeneas, who was the son
of Anchises and Venus.</p>

<p>The portico, like that behind Pompey’s theater, was an
art museum. Ancient authors mention a golden statue of
Cleopatra (one of the dictator’s few sentimental gestures?),
a golden breastplate set with British pearls, and a bronze
equestrian statue of Caesar on his famous horse which had
human front feet!</p>

<p>The ground to the south of the Forum rises over fifty
feet to the slopes of the Capitoline Hill. This difference in
level was filled with three setback stories of luxury shops
in massive rectangular blocks of <i>peperino</i>. The Street of
the Silversmiths, the <i>Clivus Argentarius</i>, ran above and behind
the shops at the Forum level. This whole complex
survives.</p>

Three men on horseback, Sulla, Pompey, and Caesar,
subdued East and West for Rome, and used part of the
profits to change the face of Rome in forty years. They
would have said that they did it out of what the Romans
called <i>pietas</i>, a threefold loyalty to family, state, and gods.
Each, to reflect credit on his family which ruled the state,
on the gods his ancestors, and on the state his perquisite,
erected great public buildings in the city to be his monument.
Sulla’s dramatic revamping of the old Forum, Pompey’s
theater and portico, and Caesar’s new Forum made
of a shabby civic center a metropolis almost worthy to
vie with the cities of the Greek East. Almost, but not quite,
for the building material was still local stone, stuccoed
tufa or the handsome limestone from Tivoli called travertine,
which weathers to a fine gold, and has ever since been
Rome’s characteristic building material. It was considered
worthy in the Renaissance to build the fabric of St. Peter’s.
For its next transformation, this time into a city of marble,
Rome had to wait for the rise to power of the greatest
nabob of them all, Caesar’s adopted son and successor,
Octavian-Augustus.</p>

<span class="subhead">Augustus: Buildings as Propaganda</span></h2>
</div>

<p>In 1922, after the success of the Fascist march on Rome,
Benito Mussolini felt acutely the need for an aura of respectability
to surround his upstart régime. Another swashbuckling
<i>condottiere</i>, 1965 years earlier, Caesar’s heir Octavian,
had felt the same need. Both resorted to the same
method: an ambitious building program, and a vigorous
propaganda campaign designed to substitute for dubious
antecedents a set of more or less spurious links with the
heroes of the glorious past. About Fascist architecture the
less said the better; the other point will be the subject of
this chapter. In fourteen years (1924–38) Italian archaeologists
changed the face of central Rome, and in the process
of glorifying <i>Il Duce</i>, added more to our knowledge of
Augustan Rome than the previous fourteen centuries had
provided.</p>

<p>Octavian’s building activity, both before and after he
took the title Augustus, was prodigious. In his autobiography
he boasts of restoring no less than eighty-two temples.
He built many new ones besides, and embellished Rome,
and his own glory, with his new Forum, a portico, his arch,
his grandiose mausoleum, an Altar of Peace, and, in addition,
arks and gardens, baths, theaters, a great library,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
markets, granaries, docks, and warehouses. Meanwhile he
himself lived in ostentatious simplicity in a modest house
on the Palatine, and encouraged the cult of antique austerity
by restoring the hut of Romulus. At his death Rome was at
last an Imperial metropolis: the city of brick had become
a city of marble. Rome had gained grandeur and lost freedom
in the process. Toward the assessment of the gains
and losses, the excavators’ discoveries in Augustus’ Forum,
at his arch, in his mausoleum, and particularly in the difficult
and ingenious recovery and reconstruction of his Altar
of Peace have made the most important contributions.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Ever since 1911, Corrado Ricci had dreamed of excavating
the site of Augustus’ Forum (see <a href="#ip_5_13">Fig. 5.13</a>), known to
lie to the northeast of and at right angles to Caesar’s, overlaid
by modern construction. In 1924 Mussolini gave him
his chance, and by 1932, when the Via dell’ Impero was
opened with Fascist pomp (see <a href="#ip_5_12">Fig. 5.12</a>), the Fora of
Caesar, Augustus, Nerva, and Trajan had all yielded up
secrets to the archaeologist’s spade.</p>

<p>Of Augustus’ Forum, when Ricci began to dig, the most
conspicuous part was the firewall at the back, separating it
from the fire-trap slums of the Subura, ancient Rome’s redlight
district. The firewall is over 100 feet high, the exposed
parts in travertine, the rest in <i>peperino</i> and <i>sperone</i>, the
traditional Italic building stones, of the period. This use of
local materials, combined, as Ricci was to discover, with
marble, is the symbol of the compromise, the amalgam of
Italic and Greek materials, methods, and forms, which is
the hallmark of the Augustan Age.</p>

<p>When the buildings cluttering the site had been cleared
away, the plan (<a href="#ip_6_1">Fig. 6.1</a>) was found to be based upon that
of Caesar’s Forum: a rectangular portico with a temple
at the back. But the rectangle was enriched at the sides with
curves, as at Palestrina earlier and in Bernini’s portico in
front of St. Peter’s later. Each of the hemicycles had, let into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
the walls on two levels, niches two feet deep, big enough
to hold statues of half life size. Excavations in the area of
the south hemicycle as early as 1889 had turned up fragments
of drapery in Carrara marble, and bits of inscriptions
which, in combination with literary evidence, gave to the
great Italian epigraphist Attilio Degrassi the clue to the subjects
of the statues. The inscriptions, called <i>elogia</i>, recorded
the <i>cursus honorum</i>, or public career, of a set of heroes,
triumphing generals, or others who had deserved well of the
Republic. Three examples are Aulus Postumius, who, with
the help of the Great Twin Brethren Castor and Pollux (the
household gods of the Julian clan), beat the Latins at the
battle of Lake Regillus in 496, and built his divine helpers
a temple in the Forum; Appius Claudius the Blind, who
built the Appian Way (312 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) and an aqueduct; and
Sulla—nabobs and builders all. But there was space in the
two levels of hemicycle niches, and in others hypothetically
restored in the portico’s rectilinear wall, for over fifty statues
with <i>elogia</i>. So Degrassi made a search for other stones
similarly inscribed, some of which turned up in the most
unlikely places.</p>

<p>One had been used as a marble roof-tile of Hadrian’s
Pantheon; it was in the Vatican collection. Another was
found in a vineyard near Rome’s north gate, the Porta del
Popolo. The former immortalized one Lucius Albinius, who
took the Vestal Virgins in his wagon to Caere for safety
when the Gauls were threatening Rome in 390 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> The latter
was of Sulla’s great rival Marius, the friend of the people.
The dimensions, letter-heights, and letter-styles of both
made their origin in Augustus’ Forum extremely likely. A
set of seven more had been known since the seventeenth
century or earlier as coming from the site of the Forum
of Arezzo, ancient Arretium, in Tuscany. The texts of some
of these turned out to be copies of <i>elogia</i> from the Forum of
Augustus. This justified the inference that in this matter
of a Hall of Fame, provincial cities imitated the metropolis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
Thus those <i>elogia</i> from Arezzo for which no Roman prototype
had been found might yet give a clue to what the
Roman collection had once contained. This inference enriches
the list by the names of Manius Valerius Maximus,
conciliator of class struggles, and Rome’s first dictator
(494 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>); Lucius Aemilius Paullus, one of the greatest
<i>triumphatores</i> of them all, who beat the Macedonians at
Pydna in 168 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and symbolized the union of Roman traditions
with Hellenism, as Augustus aspired to do; Tiberius
Sempronius Gracchus, father of the reforming Gracchi; and
Sulla’s lieutenant Lucius Licinius Lucullus, whose brother
was responsible for the terraces and hemicycles at Palestrina.</p>

<p>The south hemicycle and portico, then, ingeniously connected
Augustus’ name with a set of nabobs, builders, successful
generals, philhellenes, and men remarkable for piety
to the gods or popularity with the masses. What of the
north hemicycle? Here Ricci discovered the <i>elogium</i> of
Rome’s and Augustus’ legendary ancestor, <i>pius Aeneas</i> himself,
who also appears on the Altar of Peace; a set of the
Kings of Alba Longa; Romulus, also probably on the Altar
of Peace; Caesar’s father; Marcus Claudius Marcellus,
Augustus’ much beloved heir, whose untimely death Vergil
movingly mourns in the <i>Aeneid</i>, and whose ashes lay in
Augustus’ mausoleum; and Nero Claudius Drusus, Augustus’
stepson, who also is figured, like Aeneas and Romulus, on
the Altar of Peace. It looks very much as though the Hall
of Fame on this side of the portico was intended to connect
the legendary Kings of Alba and Home with the Julio-Claudian
dynasty. And the climax of it all was yet to come.
At the end of the north portico Ricci excavated a square
room with a pedestal at the back. On the pedestal he found
a cutting for a colossal foot, seven times life size. Forty
feet up the back wall were the put-holes for the struts of a
huge statue. Whose? The Forum’s temple was dedicated
to Mars, but the place for the god is in his temple. The
most likely candidate is the <i>Dux</i> himself, Augustus, father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
of his country, in whom Roman history came, in more
senses than one, to a full stop.</p>

<p>Medieval limekilns tell, as usual, how the rich marbles
which decorated both portico and temple were broken up
and melted down into whitewash, but three marble Corinthian
columns sixty feet high give some idea of the temple’s
grandeur. Its podium, lofty in the Italic fashion, was not
solid marble, simply tufa revetted or veneered with thin
marble slabs, an economical, and, some might say, dishonest
way of making a city of marble of the desired Hellenic
appearance. The statue-base at the back of the temple
(which was apsidal to match the hemicycles in the porticoes)
is too wide for a single figure. The cult statues must
have been of Mars and Venus, another delicate reference
to the ancestry of Augustus’ adoptive clan. The temple itself
was vowed, the literary sources tell us, at the battle
of Philippi (42 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) to Mars Ultor, avenger of the murder
of Julius Caesar, and Caesar’s sword was piously preserved
as a relic in it. The Forum did not neglect the arts. Like
Caesar’s, and like Pompey’s portico, it was a museum. It
did service also for literature: we are told that lectures
were delivered in the hemicycles. Begun in 37 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, the
Forum took thirty-five years to finish. By 2 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> other propaganda
devices—especially the arch, the Altar of Peace, Vergil’s
epic, Livy’s history, and Horace’s lyric—had, as we shall
see, given the desired respectability to Augustus, the Prince
of Peace.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>It was the victory of Actium (31 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), over the combined
fleets of Antony and Cleopatra, that enabled Octavian to
pass as the Prince of Peace. In 1888–89, in the old Forum,
between the Temples of the deified Julius and of Castor,
were excavated the footings of an arch, originally with a
single passageway, later enlarged to three. This arch was
identified from literary sources as the one erected by Augustus
to commemorate that victory, enlarged later when another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
occasion for propaganda arose. The arch itself is a
routine affair, with plenty of precedent, though one might
ponder the propriety of thus gloating over Antony, a former
colleague and a Roman citizen. (Gamberini, the excavator,
even found, in the bottom of square stone receptacles beside
the arch, laurel seeds which suggest that the tree of
victory was prominent in the landscaping of the arch.)
But, given the Roman propensity in general, and Augustus’
in particular, for propagandizing in stone, the question naturally
arose what opportunity for self-advertisement the
arch offered. The answer was not given until Degrassi published
another book in 1947.</p>

<p>For many years archaeologists had believed that on the
walls of the nearby Regia had been engraved the <i>Fasti
Consulares</i> (lists of Roman consuls from the founding of
the Republic and probably of the kings as well), and the
<i>Fasti Triumphales</i> (lists of triumphing generals from Romulus
to 19 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> I have remarked in another book<a id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> how much
one can learn of a people by what they make lists of:
Greeks, of Olympic victors; Americans, of baseball averages;
Romans, of statesmen and military heroes). But in
1935 a careful study of the Regia by the American F. E.
Brown proved that the part of its wall where the <i>Fasti</i>
must have begun was masked in the rebuilding of 36 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
by another structure, and that the space available, carefully
measured for the first time by Brown, did not fit the
surviving <i>Fasti</i>, which were discovered in 1546 and are
still preserved in the Conservatori Museum. Clearly the
Regia was not the place where the <i>Fasti</i> were inscribed.
Since two-thirds of the extant fragments were found between
the Temple of the Deified Julius and the Temple
of Castor, and since their dimensions suited those of the
footings of the Arch of Augustus, the inference was clear.
It was on the arch (<a href="#ip_6_2">Fig. 6.2</a>) that the consular <i>Fasti</i> were
carved, and this is now the universally accepted opinion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
They were displayed on either side of the lateral passageway,
where pedestrians could read them, the consular lists
framed by pilasters with a pediment above (reconstructed
in the museum by Michelangelo), the list of <i>triumphatores</i>
on the corner pilasters of the enlarged arch. The result of
this display was again, as in Augustus’ Forum, to connect
the upstart Octavian with a more respectable or heroic
past. His name appears twice among the <i>triumphatores</i>
(the slab that referred to Actium is unfortunately missing)
in a list that began with Romulus and contained the names
of the greatest heroes of Roman history; in the consular lists
his name figured twenty-four times. This collocation and
repetition could do him no harm.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_D" href="#FNanchor_D" class="fnanchor">D</a> <i>The Roman Mind at Work</i> (Van Nostrand, Princeton, 1958).</p></div>

<p>In the consular lists the names of Mark Antony and his
family have suffered <i>damnatio memoriae</i>; that is, they have
been first inscribed and then chiselled out. In the list of
<i>triumphatores</i>, on the contrary, Antony’s name is allowed
to stand. What is the legitimate inference from this? Clearly
it is that the two lists were inscribed at different times,
and that on the first occasion our <i>condottiere</i> felt a certain
insecurity, which by the time of the second had disappeared.
Literary sources date the second occasion in or
shortly after 19 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, after the Roman standards disgracefully
lost by Crassus at Carrhae had been recovered from
the Parthians. In these eleven years or so the <i>condottiere</i>
Octavian had become Augustus, the Revered One, Expander
of Empire, Father of his Country, Prince of Peace.
Within those years Vergil’s <i>Georgics</i> had cast an aura of
beauty over Octavian’s resettlement of veterans on the
land; the <i>Aeneid</i> had connected this modern Aeneas, the
pious one, the bearer of burdens, with his legendary ancestors;
Horace’s Roman Odes had praised Augustus’ religious
and moral reforms; and Livy’s history had put into
Augustan prose the lays of ancient Rome. Augustus could
afford to be magnanimous to his enemies: he had seen to
it that most of them were dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
But it was not enough that the past be controlled and
rewritten, and connected with the present on splendid
monuments. Augustus must control the future, too; even
after his death men must admire and worship him and his
dynasty. To this end he began (literary sources tell us it
was in 28 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) in the Campus Martius a massive mausoleum
(<a href="#ip_6_3">Fig. 6.3</a>), which should be reminiscent in shape of the
great Etruscan <i>tumuli</i> of centuries before, and in mass of
such wonders of the world as the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus
or the pyramids of Egypt. This monument, which
through the centuries has been successively fortress, circus,
park for fireworks displays, bull-ring, and concert-hall, was
stripped to its gaunt core in 1935, as another part of the
Fascists’ Augustan plan to attach themselves to the memory
of Augustus. The excavators, Giglioli and Colini, found
within the circular ring of the mausoleum’s vertical outer
wall a series of concentric vaulted corridors (<a href="#ip_6_4">Fig. 6.4</a>) in
concrete, rising four stories or 143 feet, surrounding a central
hollow cylinder where Augustus’ ashes were to lie. A
statue of the great deceased would have surmounted the
cylinder, and the whole massive structure would have been
heaped with earth and planted with cypresses. Before the
door stood the bronze tablets bearing Augustus’ autobiography—a
calmly audacious fabrication of history, it has
been justly called. In the corridor around the central cylinder
were placed the marble containers for the urns of
members of the dynasty. Some of the containers were found
<i>in situ</i>, though their ashes—and, ironically, Augustus’ as well—had
long ago disappeared.</p>

<p>(G. Lugli, <i>Mon. Ant.</i>, 3, p. 197)</p></div></div>

<p>It was Augustus’ fate to outlive his lieutenants, his relatives
(see the family tree, <a href="#ip_6_5">Fig. 6.5</a>), and all his favorite
candidates for the succession. There lay, for example, the
ashes of his stepson Drusus, his nephew, the young Marcellus,
and his grandchildren, Lucius and Gaius; his lieutenant Agrippa;
his sister Octavia, once given in a dynastic
marriage to Mark Antony; his stepson Tiberius’ one-time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
wife Agrippina, divorced to give place to Augustus’ daughter.
Agrippina survived Augustus; who knows what palace
intrigue brought her ashes here? Her one-time husband’s
ashes rested here, too, and those of Germanicus, Tiberius’
adopted son, also those of the mad Emperor Caligula, of
Claudius, Vespasian, Nerva, and Septimius Severus’ consort
Julia Domna (for the Severan dynasty, too, had need of
respectability).</p>

<p>In stripping the mausoleum to its core, and building a
deplorable neo-Fascist <i>piazza</i> on one side of it, an equally
deplorable concrete shed for the reconstructed Altar of
Peace on the other, the archaeologists of the ’30s stripped
Augustus, too, of his pretensions. Yet the decayed grandeur,
the disappointed hopes, the inevitable passing of régimes,
strike their own note of pathos and mortality:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0"><i>Look on my works, ye mighty, and despair.</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>However unfortunate the building that protects it may
be, the reconstructed Altar of Peace in the Field of Mars
must be recognized as one of the great triumphs of Italian
archaeology. Sculptured reliefs from this structure were
first discovered, though not recognized as such, as long ago
as 1568, in the underpinnings of what is now the Palazzo
Fiano, on the Corso, Rome’s <i>cardo</i>, which overlies the
ancient Great North Road, the Via Flaminia. Other soundings
were made in 1859 and 1903, and the reliefs were first
recognized as belonging to the altar in 1879. But it was not
until 1937–38 that G. Moretti carried through the incredibly
ingenious and patient work which led to the almost complete
recovery and reconstruction of the altar and the historic
sculptured frieze surrounding it.</p>

A colossal engineering problem arose because the Palazzo
Fiano rested upon wooden piles driven into the water which
in this part of Rome underlies most of the buildings. These
piles, and reinforcements to them, pinned down some of the
marble blocks of the altar itself. To get the blocks out by
ordinary methods, even if the water level had made it possible,
would have caused the collapse of the building. Previous
excavators had resorted to driving narrow, damp, dark
tunnels, with incomplete results. Moretti resolved on more
heroic measures; the solution is a credit to modern Italian
engineering. The weightiest and worst-supported part of the
palace lay directly over the altar; there were deep splits
in the palace walls; only the extraordinary tenacity of the
<i>pozzolana</i> mortar held them together. With infinite capacity
for taking pains, the damaged parts of the walls were taken
down and, by injection of liquid concrete, restored segment
by segment, brick by brick. (The Italians call this process
<i>cuci e scuci</i>, sew and unsew.) The subsoil was so uneven
in profile and so soaking wet that a new masonry substructure
was impossible. Moretti, in consultation with his engineers,
determined to shift the weight of the palace wall onto
a sort of enormous sawhorse or <i>cavaletto</i> (<a href="#ip_6_6">Fig. 6.6</a>) of reinforced
concrete. Holes were drilled sixty-five feet to a
firm footing and filled with concrete; on this were built
concrete piers to support the legs of the sawhorse. Between
each pier and the corresponding leg was inserted a hydraulic
jack (<i>martinetto</i>) adjustable to suit the various stresses
exerted by the bearing walls. A grid of steel girders ran
from pier to pier for reinforcement.</p>

and a dike frozen around the remains of the altar. (G. Moretti, <i>Ara Pacis Augustae</i>, Pl. 36)</div></div>

<p>Once the corner of the building was supported by the
concrete sawhorse, the problem was only half-solved, for
water covered the altar up to the top of the outside steps.
Pumping was labor in vain; it would only have weakened
the substructure of the palace and adjoining buildings.
What were needed were dikes, to keep the water out while
the area inside them was emptied. But a cement dike was
impossible, because of the maze of water, gas, and sewer
mains, heat, power, and light conduits which, at all levels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
and in all directions, crisscrossed the subsoil of this busy
part of modern Rome. A trench about five feet wide was
dug, with a 230-foot perimeter. From a horizontal pipe laid
in it, fifty-five three-inch pipes ran down vertically at equal
intervals to a depth of twenty-four feet. Into these pipes
was pumped carbon dioxide under a pressure of eighty atmospheres.
Radiation from the refrigerant in the vertical
pipes froze the surrounding muddy earth, and the impenetrable
dike was a reality. The water inside covering the
altar was then pumped out, and all the architectural blocks
and fragments could be removed. Thus succeeded one of
the most difficult and delicate excavations ever made. All
was finished to meet a deadline, the bimillennary of Augustus’
birth, September 23, 1938.</p>

<p>What Moretti now had to work with in his reconstruction
was not only the slabs and fragments he had just extracted,
but also the finds from previous excavations going back to
1568 (<a href="#ip_6_7">Fig. 6.7</a>). Over the intervening years these had been
scattered. Most of the 1568 finds had been sawn into three
lengthwise (for the slabs were over two feet thick, too heavy
for easy transport) and shipped to Florence to the Grand
Duke of Tuscany, who then owned the Palazzo Fiano site
in Rome. One slab was in the Vatican Museum, another
in the Villa Medici (seat of the French Academy in
Rome), still another in the Louvre. The finds from the
1859 dig had also been kept unrestored in the palace,
and then transferred to Rome’s Terme Museum. One slab
was found in re-use face down as a cover for a tomb in
Rome’s Church of the Gesù.</p>

excavation, still <i>in situ</i> under the Palazzo Fiano. (Moretti, <i>op. cit.</i>, Pl. 5)</div></div>

<p>These were all decorative elements. Under the Palazzo
Fiano still remain the tufa footings and some of the travertine
pavement (<a href="#ip_6_8">Fig. 6.8</a>). These, though they were not removed,
made it possible to visualize and reconstruct the
plan. The altar itself, in the center of its enclosed platform,
proved to be U-shaped, with the open end of the U facing
west, toward the Campus Martius, and approached by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
flight of steps. The whole was fenced off by a marble wall
about thirty feet square and sixteen feet high, with wide
doorways on east and west. Since the pavement sloped, and
there was provision for drainage, the inference was warranted
that the altar was originally open to the sky. Each
face of the enclosure wall bore two wide horizontal decorative
bands separated by narrower bands, on the outer face
of meanders, on the inner, of palmettes. On the outer face
the wide upper band bore a frieze with over 100 figures; the
lower one motifs from nature: acanthus scrolls, bunches of
grapes, the swans of Augustus’ patron Apollo, and a lively
population of small animals. The inner face carried, above,
a motif of swags of fruit festooned between ox-skulls (<i>bucrania</i>);
below, a series of long, narrow, recessed, vertical
panels, giving the effect, in marble, of a wooden fence.
Many of the Slabs were found where they fell and were
easily fitted into their proper place in the reconstruction
(<a href="#ip_6_9">Fig. 6.9</a>). Of the slabs in museums casts were taken. Thanks
to careful observation of joins, repeats of floral motifs, the
identity of historic figures, veins in the marble, and treatment
of unexposed surfaces, these slabs, too, found their
proper places. The job was done in the workrooms of the
Terme Museum, with twenty-four large cases of fragments
to work with, plus the full slabs and casts. The altar was
finally rebuilt on the banks of the Tiber next to Augustus’
mausoleum.</p>

<p>The result was worth the effort, for the Altar of Peace is
universally acknowledged to be the greatest artistic masterpiece
of the Augustan Age, blending Roman spirit with
Greek forms, occupying in Roman art the same exalted position
as the Parthenon frieze in Greek, and destined to
inspire, as we shall see, many monuments with historic subjects
in the following decades and centuries.</p>

<p>The figured upper panels on the enclosure’s outer face are
the most interesting part of the monument. On the north
and south faces a procession moves westward. It is imagined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
as turning the corner of the enclosure and entering the west
doorway to sacrifice at the altar. The heads on the north
side were heavily restored in the Renaissance, but the fasces,
the laurel crowns, the senatorial shoes and rings, the cult
objects carried make it clear that the procession is of magistrates
and priests. The south side, which faced the city, must
have been considered the most important half, and here,
indeed, many historical figures of Augustus’ family and
court have been identified. It is noteworthy how the division
of the friezes into dynastic and non-dynastic halves parallels
the arrangement of the Hall of Fame in Augustus’
Forum.</p>

<p>The face in the upper right corner of the fragmentary
left panel in <a href="#ip_6_10">Fig. 6.10</a>, though cracked badly across the
eye (for the whole weight of the Palazzo Fiano rested
upon it for centuries), is recognizable from other portraits,
from what remains of the profile, and from the treatment
of the hair, as Augustus himself. The figures in the spiked
caps to the far right are <i>flamines</i>, priests of Jupiter and
Mars. The figure second to the left of the first <i>flamen</i>, all
by himself in the background, is a spectator, the very type
of the old Republican Roman. Lictors with the fasces precede
the figure to the spectator’s left of Augustus. This
figure, then, must be the consul of the year, with the other
consul on the other side of the Emperor.</p>

<p>But of which year? The consuls of the year 13 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, when
the building of the altar was officially decreed, were Varus
(who fell in the Teutoberg forest twenty-two years later)
and Tiberius. Those of the year 9 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, when the altar was
consecrated, were Drusus and Quinctius Crispinus. Now the
slab pictured in <a href="#ip_6_11">Fig. 6.11</a> contains on its left edge, on either
side of the veiled background figure with her finger on her
lips (who is Augustus’ sister Octavia) a family group. This
has been almost certainly identified as Drusus (in uniform,
with short tunic), and his wife, Antonia Minor, holding their
son Germanicus by the hand. Drusus can hardly be in two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
places at once. Therefore the consuls on the earlier slab are
those of 13 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and the whole procession is imagined as
that of the altar’s <i>constitutio</i>, when the marble version was
not yet finished, not yet, perhaps, even begun. This hypothesis
explains the treatment of the enclosure’s inner face,
where the recessed panels represent a temporary wooden
fence. The swags in marble relief, of barley, grapes, olives,
figs, apples, pears, plums, cherries, pine cones, nuts, oak
leaves, ivy, laurel, and poppy—all the riches of a fertile
Italy at peace—were originally painted, like Della Robbia
terracottas, against a blue background. They must have
been intended to render the natural festoons swinging in
the open air against the blue sky. The <i>paterae</i>, or sacrificial
bowls, in two alternating patterns of gilded marble,
which hang above the swags, must be imagined as suspended
from an upper crossbar.</p>

<p>The persons in <a href="#ip_6_12">Fig. 6.12</a> are of the greatest historical
interest. The tall man with a fold of his toga over his head,
whose careworn face and pronounced Roman nose make a
recognizable portrait, can be identified from other likenesses
as Augustus’ lieutenant Agrippa, acting as Pontifex
Maximus. The child clinging to his toga is then one of his
sons, Gaius or Lucius. Gaius, the elder, born in 20 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>,
would have been, in 13, of the age represented here; a
modern symbol of Aeneas’ son Ascanius, or Romulus, the
son of Mars. The woman in the background with her hand
on his head would then be Gaius’ mother Julia, Augustus’
daughter, whom he was later to banish for her immoral
conduct. The older woman in the foreground, the most
carefully wrought female figure in either frieze, would then
be Julia’s stepmother, the redoubtable Empress Livia.</p>

<p>The family group to the right of Drusus in <a href="#ip_6_11">Fig. 6.11</a> is
also pregnant with history. The shapely woman with her
hand on the small boy’s shoulder is identified as Antonia
Major, Mark Antony’s daughter by Octavia. The small boy
grasping a fold of his uncle Drusus’ cloak grew up to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
father the Emperor Nero. The girl to the spectator’s right
of the small boy is his sister Domitia; her father, Lucius
Domitius Ahenobarbus, later commander of the Roman
army in Germany, has his hand raised over her head. The
elderly background figure with the kindly, lined face is
perhaps Maecenas, Augustus’ secretary of state for propaganda,
the patron of Vergil and Horace.</p>

<p>The whole atmosphere of the procession is very Italian,
quite intimate and informal, without central focus. Its members
face in all directions, and are so incorrigibly chatty that
Octavia must command silence, finger to lips. Here, in these
realistic groups, are the living likenesses of some of the men
and women whose ashes later lay in Augustus’ mausoleum,
of some of the men and women who made a Golden Age.
Here are the pages of history made flesh, and here are all
the basic ideas of the Augustan program: the pretense of
the revived Republic, in the consuls and lictors; the emphasis
on religion, in the <i>flamines</i> and the veiled Pontifex;
the dynastic hopes, in little Gaius; the subvention of literature,
in Maecenas.</p>

<p>The east and west ends of the enclosure each contain, on
either side of the doorways, a figured panel, four in all, of
which two are well preserved. The one to the right of the
main (west) entrance portrays a grave, bearded figure (<a href="#ip_6_13">Fig. 6.13</a>)
offering sacrifices, with the aid of two acolytes, upon
a rustic altar before a small temple containing tiny figures
of the Penates as Castor and Pollux, whose connection with
the <i>gens Iulia</i> we have already noted. The sow in the lower
left corner is the famous one with the thirty piglets, whose
discovery was to tell Aeneas where to found his city. (What
purported to be the original sow and all the piglets, pickled
in brine, was on display in a Latin town in Augustus’ age.)
From the sow the inference is that the bearded figure is
Aeneas; he symbolized the past of Rome, and the ancestry
of Augustus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
The panel to the left of the east entrance (<a href="#ip_6_14">Fig. 6.14</a>) has
as its central figure a full-breasted woman, whose face closely
resembles the Livia of the south frieze. She has fruits in her
lap, chubby naked babies in her arms, a miniature cow and
a sheep at her feet, grain and poppies behind her. She is
flanked by obviously allegorical figures of Air (riding a
swan), and Water (riding a sea monster). Fresh water
gushes from an amphora in the lower left corner; a saltwater
harbor (indicated by waves, and perhaps the arch
in the background) is at the lower right. Surely this is
<i>Saturnia Tellus</i>, the fruitful earth of an Italy at peace, that
Vergil sang of in the <i>Georgics</i>, rich in crops, flocks, and
herds, but fruitful most of all in <i>men</i>. Of the two fragmentary
panels, the west one is restored as a scene of Mars, the Shepherd,
the wolf, and the twins Romulus and Remus. (The
Mars was acquired from a private owner in Vienna, whose
Roman art dealer had told him it came from the Palazzo
Fiano.) The east one, the least well preserved of all, probably
represented the goddess Roma seated upon a trophy
of arms, like Britannia on an English penny. Thus one pair
of end panels is symbolical, while the other is mythological;
the processional frieze deals with contemporary history.
The whole makes a tripartite arrangement which is artistically
very satisfying. At the same time, victorious Rome,
fruitful Italy, the remote founder, and the first king, are all
symbolically related here, as in other Augustan monuments,
to the contemporary scene and the fortunes of the
dynasty.</p>

<p>After the grandeur of the enclosure, the decoration of
the altar itself seems modest and unpretentious, perhaps deliberately
so. Winged sphinxes support rich volutes, the
graceful S-curves which bound the altar table on either side.
Beneath, there is a sacrificial scene, with the six Vestal
Virgins neatly arranged in order of size. In the sacrificial
scene itself, the victims are a steer, a heifer, and a fleecy
sheep. The attendants carry the sacrificial knives, platters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
pitchers, and other paraphernalia. One twists the horns of
the steer, another the tail of the heifer, to keep them moving.
Altar and enclosure together provide our most complete
visual record of a Roman state religious ceremony.
And the whole complex, with its religiosity and historicity,
is prolific of descendants: the Arch of Titus, the Cancelleria
reliefs (to be discussed in Chapter IX), Trajan’s Column
(to be discussed in Chapter X), his arch at Beneventum,
the Arch of Constantine, the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
the Arch of Septimius Severus. It is the prototype of them
all, and the most masterly: tranquil, unpretentious, stately
yet intimate, delighting in nature, perfectly balanced between country
and city, perfectly symbolizing the Augustan
Peace, when men would beat their swords into plowshares,
and study war no more. But within 100 years the altar began
to be neglected. Perhaps, looking behind the façade, some
old Republicans were moved to ask, “Where is the Altar
of Liberty?”</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>A Forum, an arch, a tomb, an altar: taken together, as
recent archaeology has revealed them to us, they epitomize
the Augustan Age. In the Forum and the arch, the past
recaptured, and pressed into the service of the régime. In
the altar, the heroic and warlike past implicit in the orderly
and peaceful present. In the tomb, posterity, the future
generations, invited to marvel at the dynasty and what it
has wrought. Behind all this, we can see that Augustus, the
most ruthless power politician of them all, was simply continuing
the careers of the great captains and dynasts of the
past, like Caesar, Pompey, and Sulla. The refulgence of
the monuments but reflects his monolithic control of the
state, his cracking open of the seams of the old régime. In
the history of art and architecture, Augustus’ contribution
is the applying of a standardized scheme of décor, as he
applied a standardized scheme of administration, to the
whole Empire. Henceforward Rome is the producer. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
crystallized the styles and re-exported them to the world
that lay at her feet. Next we shall see how the Julio-Claudian
Emperors, from Tiberius to Nero, exploited what Augustus
had begun.</p>

<span class="subhead">Hypocrite, Madman, Fool, and Knave</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Roman historians branded the Julio-Claudian successors of
Augustus—Tiberius (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 14–37), Caligula (37–41), Claudius
(41–54) and Nero (54–68)—as a hypocrite, a madman, a
fool, and a knave. The hypocrite spent millions rehabilitating
Asia Minor after an earthquake, the madman provided
Ostia with a splendid aqueduct, the fool built for the same
city a great artificial harbor, the knave rebuilt Rome—after
burning it down first, his enemies said—with a new and
intelligent city plan. But it would be easy to interpret the
Julio-Claudian age as one of conspicuous consumption and
conspicuous waste: there were many who fiddled before
Rome ever burned. Thus both Tiberius and Caligula built
on the Palatine grandiose palaces, and Nero’s Golden House,
as we shall see, outdid them all. Tiberius’ monstrous barracks
at the city wall for the praetorian guard introduces
a sinister note. Claudius’ Altar of Piety, modelled on Augustus’
Altar of Peace, shows how derivative official art can
be. Out of the complexity of this half-century, as archaeology
reveals it to us, I have chosen four examples, one from
each reign: a stately pleasure-dome of Tiberius by the sea
at Sperlonga; a pair of extraordinary houseboats, probably
Caligula’s, from the Lake of Nemi; the curious subterranean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
basilica at the Porta Maggiore in Rome, which flourished
briefly and mysteriously in the reign of Claudius; and Nero’s
fabulous Golden House.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In August, 1957, road improvements near Sperlonga, on
the coast, about sixty-six miles southeast of Rome, offered
G. Iacopi of the Terme Museum the opportunity for partially
restoring, and closely examining, the ruins of a well-known
villa there, commonly called the Villa of Tiberius.
Making soundings near the villa in a wide, lofty cave fronting
on the beach (<a href="#ip_7_1">Fig. 7.1</a>), partly filled with sea-water,
Iacopi discovered that the natural cave had been made over
into a <i>nymphaeum</i> or <i>vivarium</i>, a round artificial fish-pool,
with a large pedestal for statuary in the middle, and artificial
grottoes opening behind (<a href="#ip_7_2">Fig. 7.2</a>). In the pool and
the grottoes, buried under masses of fallen rock, Iacopi and
his assistants found an enormous quantity—at last accounts
over 5500 fragments—of statuary. The fallen rock gave a
clue for dating at least one phase of the cave’s existence,
and a possible confirmation of the popular name for the
adjoining villa. For the historian Tacitus mentions that in
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 26, Tiberius, dining in a natural cave at his villa at
Spelunca, was saved from being crushed under falling rock
by the heroism of his prefect of the praetorian guard, Sejanus,
who protected him with his own body. This is very
likely the actual cave which Iacopi explored, though his
discoveries suggest that there were additions after Tiberius’
time.</p>

<p>The exploration was carried on under difficulties of several
kinds. The Italian budget for archaeology is notoriously
inadequate; the cave was subject to flooding from springs,
and lashing by winter storms; and it contained a dangerous
quantity of ammunition and explosives stored there in World
War II. The first difficulty was temporarily overcome by
the generosity of the engineer in charge of the road-building
nearby; the second by installing three pumps and building
a dike; the third by keeping an ordnance expert constantly
on duty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
When the finds from the cave were first reported in the
press, great excitement was caused by the announcement—premature,
as it turned out—that among the fragments of
sculpture were some resembling the Laocoön group. The
original Laocoön group had been described by Pliny the Elder
as carved out of a single block, probably with the sculptors’
names on the base, whereas the famous Vatican Laocoön
is not monolithic and is unsigned. Among the Sperlonga finds,
on the other hand, were fragments of a Greek inscription giving
the names of the three Rhodian sculptors mentioned by
Pliny (but not in the precise form transcribed by him: in the
Sperlonga inscriptions, their fathers’ names are recorded, in
Pliny not), plus some colossal pieces (the central figure
would have been nineteen feet eight inches tall) including
parts of two snake-like monsters, presumably the serpents
sent by Athena to punish Laocoön and his sons for resisting
the proposal to drag the Wooden Horse within the walls of
Troy. This great group, much larger, earlier (according to
Iacopi, on the somewhat doubtful evidence of the letter-styles
of the Greek inscription, which he would date in the
second or first century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) than the Vatican version, and
different in conception, fits the pedestal in the middle of
the circular pool.</p>

<p>Another inscription goes some way to explain both the
quantity and the arrangement of the sculpture in the grotto.
In ten lines of Latin verse it describes how a certain Faustinus
adorned the cave with sculpture for the pleasure of
his Imperial masters, choosing subjects which, Vergil himself
would admit, outdid his own poetry. One of the subjects
mentioned is Scylla, the fabulous cave-dwelling sea-monster,
with a girdle of dogs’ heads about her loins, who guarded
the straits of Messina. Now in the cave, carved in the living
rock, at the right of the entrance, is the prow of a ship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
set with blue, green, yellow, and red mosaic, and presenting
some evidence of having once had a marble superstructure.
To this ship Iacopi would assign some of his key figures:
a bearded Ulysses in a seaman’s cap, his face expressing
horror; a lovely archaic statuette of Athena (<a href="#ip_7_3">Fig. 7.3</a>),
grasped by a huge hand (Athena might be the figurehead);
Scylla’s gigantic hand seizing a seaman by the hair, and a
terrified mariner who has taken refuge from Scylla at the
ship’s prow. A niche carved in the rock above the ship
would be an appropriate vantage-point for Scylla herself;
in one fragment one of her dog’s heads has bitten deep into
a sailor’s shoulder. It is true that the mosaic names the ship
<i>Argo</i>, but Iacopi explains this as a generic name for a
ship, not necessarily referring to the one that bore the
Argonauts.</p>

<p>If Iacopi is right about this group, it was a baroque or
even rococo effect that Faustinus arranged for his Imperial
masters. But the Laocoön and Scylla groups by no means
exhausted his fancy or his pocketbook: there was Menelaus
with the body of Patroclus, Ganymede borne to heaven by
an eagle (carved so as to be seen to best effect from below,
and therefore possibly belonging to a pedimental treatment
of the cave façade). There are heads of gods and heroes,
satyrs and fauns, a charming Cupid trying on a satyr’s mask,
a delightful head of a baby with ringlets over the ears—all
in the fanciful, complex, sometimes tortured baroque style
of Hellenistic Pergamum and Rhodes. These are all of fine
crystalline Greek island marble, so that they may be Greek
originals. The soapy native Carrara stone is normally used
in Roman copies—and in too much modern American church
sculpture.</p>

<p>At the present writing the Sperlonga cave cannot be said
to have yielded up all its secrets. It is not even certain that
the equipping of Tiberius’ outdoor dining-room as a lavish
baroque museum took place in Tiberius’ lifetime, for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
donor, Faustinus, may be the rich villa-owner of that name
who was a friend of the poet Martial, and therefore of Domitianic
date. The residents of Sperlonga want the sculpture
kept where it was found, to entice tourists; the archaeologists
want to take it to Rome for analysis and reconstruction.
Meanwhile, definitive conclusions are impossible. But one
thing is certain: the bizarre taste of the place, whether
Tiberius’ or Domitian’s, is characteristic of the first century
of the Empire, and reflects the gap between the ostentatious
rich and the church-mouse poor which was one day to
contribute to the Empire’s fall.</p>

Seventeen miles southeast of Rome, cupped in green volcanic
hills, lies the beautiful deep blue Lake of Nemi, the
mirror of Diana. Here divers, as long ago as 1446, reported,
lying on the bottom in from sixteen to sixty-nine feet of
water, two ships, presumably ancient Roman. A descent was
made in a diving bell in 1535. Another attempt in 1827 used
a large raft with hoists and grappling irons, and an art dealer
tried again in 1895, but all three efforts were chiefly successful
in damaging the hulls, tearing away great chunks
without being able to raise the Ships to the surface. The
1895 attempt did, however, produce a mass of tantalizing
fragments (<a href="#ip_7_4">Fig. 7.4</a>): beams; lead water-pipe; ball-bearings;
a number of objects in bronze, including animal heads holding
rings in their teeth, a Medusa, and a large flat hand;
terracotta revetment plaques, a quantity of rails and spikes,
and a large piece of decking in mosaic. This treasure-trove,
displayed in the Terme Museum, naturally whetted appetites,
not least Mussolini’s. He determined to get at the
ships by lowering the level of the lake, a colossal task
undertaken eagerly by civil and naval engineers enthusiastic
about classical civilization. The job was made easier, but
no less expensive, because there existed an ancient artificial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
outlet, a tunnel a mile long, dating from the reign of Claudius,
which could be used to carry off the overflow. The
pumps were started on October 20, 1928, in the presence of
the <i>Duce</i>. After various vicissitudes over a space of four
years, the lake level was lowered seventy-two feet, and
by November, 1932, the first ship was installed in a hangar
on the shore, and the second (<a href="#ip_7_5">Fig. 7.5</a>) lay exposed in
the mud.</p>

<p>The ships proved to be enormous by ancient standards,
of very shallow draft, very broad in the beam (one was
sixty-six feet wide, the other seventy-eight) and respectively
234 and 239 feet long (<a href="#ip_7_6">Fig. 7.6</a>). They were larger
than some of the early Atlantic liners. Their 1100 tons burden
gave them ten times the tonnage of Columbus’ largest
ship.</p>

<p>The task of freeing the ships of mud and debris, recording
the finds level by level, reinforcing the hulls with iron,
shoring them up, raising and transporting them to the
special museum built for them on the lake shore proved in
its way to be as great a challenge to Italian patience and
ingenuity as the job of excavating the slabs and fragments
of the Altar of Peace from under the Palazzo Fiano. There
was always the danger of the ships’ settling in the mud
in a convex curve, springing the beams. The excavating
tools used were made entirely of wood; iron would have
damaged the ancient timbers. As each section of the hull
emerged from the water that had covered it for so many
centuries, it was covered with wet canvas to keep it from
deteriorating.</p>

<p>The hulls proved to be full of flat tiles set in mortar.
These overlaid the oak decking, and over these again was
a pavement in polychrome marble and mosaic. Fluted
marble columns were found in the second ship, suggesting
a rich and heavy superstructure (<a href="#ip_7_7">Fig. 7.7</a>). A round pine
timber from the first ship, thirty-seven feet long and sixteen
inches in diameter, with a bronze cap ornamented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
with a lion holding a ring in its teeth, proved to be a
sweep rudder, one of a pair. It showed that these enormously
heavy vessels (the decking material alone must
have weighed 600 or 700 metric tons) were actually intended
to be practicable, and to move about in the waters
of the lake.</p>

<p>Clay tubes, flanged like sewer-pipe to fit into each other,
were arranged in pairs to make an air-space between one
level of deck and another. This suggests radiant or hypocaust
heating, as in a Roman bath: these floating palaces,
or temples, or whatever they were—perhaps both—had bathing
facilities. Wooden shutters warrant the inference that
the ships were provided with private cabins. A length of
lead water-pipe stamped with the name of Caligula has
been used to date the ships to that reign (and indeed in
some ways they accord well with Caligula’s reputation for
madness), but of course there is nothing to prevent lead
pipe of Caligula’s short reign (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 37–41) from being used
in Claudius’, and many scholars, on the evidence of the art
objects found, would date the ships in the latter reign.</p>

<p>Boards in the bottom of the hold were removable to
facilitate cleaning out the bilge. This was done with an
endless belt of buckets, some of which were found, and
are on display, restored, in the museum. Over the ribs of
the hull was pine planking, then a thin coating of plaster,
then a layer of wool treated with tar or pitch, finally lead
sheathing clinched with large-headed copper nails.</p>

<p>The second ship had outriggers supporting a platform for
the oarsmen, and a bronze taffrail decorated with herms—miniature
busts tapering into square shafts. A number of
mechanical devices of great technical interest was found:
pump-pistons; pulleys; wooden platforms (use unknown),
one mounted on ball-bearings, another on roller-bearings;
a double-action bronze stem-valve (perhaps for use in
pumping out the bilge), which had been welded at a high
temperature (1800° Fahrenheit); anchors, one with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
knot tied by a Roman sailor still intact, another with a
moveable stock, anticipating by over 1800 years a similar
model patented by the British Admiralty in 1851. Its use
is to cant the anchor, giving it a better bite in the mud.</p>

<p>In 1944 the retreating Germans wantonly burned the
ships in their museum. Their gear, stored in a safe place,
survived. From careful drawings made at the time the ships
were raised, models were made to one-fifth scale. They are
now on display in the restored museum.</p>

<p>The ships did not contain within themselves clear evidence
about what they were used for. Whether they had
some religious purpose in connection with the nearby Temple
of Diana, or were used as pleasure-craft, or both, they
reflect, like the cave at Sperlonga, the mad extravagance
which increasingly characterized the Roman Empire on
its road to absolutism.</p>

<p>In 1917, on Rome’s birthday, April 21, a landslip beside
the Rome-Naples railway line outside the Porta Maggiore
revealed, forty-two feet beneath the tracks, a hitherto unsuspected
and most remarkable underground, vaulted, stucco-ornamented
room, the so-called “basilica,” which will serve
as a third example of archaeology’s contribution to our
knowledge of the Julio-Claudian age. To protect the basilica
against damage from seepage and vibration from
trains—240 a day pass directly above it—it was enclosed
in 1951–52, at a cost of over $500,000, in a great box of
waterproof reinforced concrete with footings anchored
nearly twenty-four feet beneath the level of the basilica
pavement.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 7.8</span> Rome, subterranean basilica at Porta Maggiore, general view.</p>

<p>(Fototeca)</p></div></div>

<p>One entered the chamber in antiquity—it was always underground—down
a long vaulted ramp which made a right-angle
turn and emerged in a little square vestibule, whose
skylight provided the basilica’s only natural light. Beyond
the vestibule was a vaulted nave (<a href="#ip_7_8">Fig. 7.8</a>) ending in an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
apse, and two side aisles. The profiles of the piers upholding
the vaults, and of the arches connecting the nave with the
side aisles, are irregular; and the piers are set at eccentric
angles (<a href="#ip_7_9">Fig. 7.9</a>): this suggests a curious method of construction.
A trench must have been dug through the surface
tufa corresponding to the desired perimeter of the building.
Then six square pits were dug, one for each pier, and the
outline of the arches and doorways formed in the virgin
soil. Then mortar was poured in. When it had set, the
entrance corridor was dug and the interior of the basilica
emptied of earth through the skylight in the vestibule. Then
vault, piers, and walls were stuccoed. In the late Republic
and after, Roman artisans showed great skill in ornamental
stucco-work, a far cry from the wattle-and-daub, in the
primitive huts, which is the remote ancestor of the refined
work in the basilica, and a symbol of how far on the road
to sophistication Rome had traveled from her humble
beginnings.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 7.9</span> Rome, subterranean basilica at Porta Maggiore.</p>

<p>(<i>Legacy of Rome</i>, p. 407)</p></div></div>

<p>In the basilica the stucco-work is divided by moldings
into squares, rectangles, and lozenges, filled with figures in
low relief of great delicacy and elegance. Some are simple<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
scenes of daily life, and many others are part of the standard
repertory of Roman art, but the key motifs will bear,
as we shall see, a single, serious interpretation. The apse,
the focal point of the whole structure, was reserved for a
special scene of central importance.</p>

<p>The central panel of the central vault shows a naked
human figure, a pitcher in his hand, carried off by a winged
creature. (The interior of the figure is eaten out; this is
due not to vandalism but to the depredations of a parasitic
insect related to the termite.) In the four surrounding
panels are four other motifs. A hero wearing a lion’s skin
shoots with a bow a monster guarding a maiden chained
to a rock. A beautiful, seated, half-naked woman cradles a
statuette in her left arm; a bearded middle-aged man stands
before her. A young man in a short tunic, carrying a leafy
branch or a shepherd’s crook, leads off a woman by the
hand. A veiled female figure takes from a tree guarded by
a serpent a fleecy object to give to a man kneeling on a
table nearby. How are these scenes to be interpreted? Do
they share a common motif? According to the French Professor
Jérome Carcopino, they do.</p>

<p>The central subject is Ganymede borne heavenward to
be Jupiter’s cup bearer. The hero with the lion’s skin is
Hercules rescuing Hesione. The woman with the statuette
is Helen with the Palladium, the ancient image on which
Troy’s safety depended; the wise Ulysses stands before her.
Or it might be Iphigenia, in faraway Tauris, about to bear
past the Thracian King Thoas the statuette of Artemis
which will release her brother Orestes from torment by
the Furies. In the next panel, if the young man is carrying
a branch, he is Orpheus bringing Eurydice back from
Hades; if he is carrying a shepherd’s crook, he is Paris kidnaping
Helen. The veiled female is of course Medea getting
the Golden Fleece for Jason. The common theme is
deliverance. Ganymede, liberated from earthly ties, is
borne on wings to the bliss of Heaven. Hercules can free<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
Hesione because, according to some versions of the myth,
he has been initiated into the mysteries. The statue, whether
of Athena or of Artemis, guarantees the safety of the city
or person who possesses it. Helen, in some accounts, can
read the future and assuage men’s pain; or, if the theme is
Orpheus and Eurydice we may recall that in an early version
of the myth the ending was happy. Jason and Medea
are freed from fear of the dragon through rites of magic
initiation.</p>

<div id="ip_7_10" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_059.jpg" width="600" height="512" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 7.10</span> Rome, subterranean basilica at Porta Maggiore, apse.</p>

<p>(Fototeca)</p></div></div>

<p>Does the great scene in the apse (<a href="#ip_7_10">Fig. 7.10</a>) harmonize
with the interpretation? In it, on the right, a graceful veiled
woman, holding the lyre of a poetess, descends a cliff into
the sea. She is pushed by a baby winged figure standing
behind her. Beneath, waist deep in the water, a figure with
a cloak outspread stands ready to receive her and escort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
her to the opposite shore. There, on another cliff, stands
an imposing naked male figure, in his left hand a bow, his
right outstretched in blessing. Behind him sits a young man
thoughtfully supporting his head on his hand. Below in the
sea yet another figure holds an oar and blows a horn in
greeting. Any Roman intellectual would recognize the
scene: it is Sappho, encouraged by Cupid, received by
Tritons, blessed by Apollo, making the lover’s leap to join
her beloved Phaon for eternity. This is not suicide, but liberation
from earthly love into an eternity of perfect harmony
of the senses with the sublime and the supernatural. The
scene is consistent with the others, and provides a further
clue to the interpretation of the whole, for Pliny the Elder,
in his encyclopaedic <i>Natural History</i>, says that the myth
of Sappho and Phaon was made much of by a sect called
neo-Pythagoreans, inspired by the number-mysticism, and
the belief in immortality, of their founder, Pythagoras of
Samos, who flourished in the late sixth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> These
beliefs were refined in the Hellenistic Age, and taken up by
heterodox Roman intellectuals.</p>

<p>This elegant underground chamber, so restrained and
literary in décor, so small in size (it measures less than
thirty by thirty-six feet) is just the place for a chapel for
such an élite and aristocratic sect of ancient freemasons.
The hypothesis is borne out by the discovery beneath the
floor of the bones of a puppy and a suckling pig, the preferred
<i>pièces de résistance</i> for a neo-Pythagorean cult meal,
perhaps the meal that inaugurated the chapel.</p>

<p>And still other motifs in the stucco decoration strengthen
the hypothesis, by stressing redemption, salvation, initiation:
a winged victory; a soul arriving in the Isles of the
Blest; a woman with a flower, symbolizing Hope; a scene
of Demeter, the earth goddess, and Triptolemus, the hero
of agriculture, of whom much was made in the Eleusinian
mysteries. Other reliefs show the reverse of the coin: the
punishment of the uninitiate. The satyr Marsyas is flayed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
alive for presuming to challenge Apollo to a competition
in music. The Danaids, for the crime of murdering their
husbands, perform forever the useless labor of drawing
water in perforated jars. There are other sinners: Medea
with her slain sons; Pasiphaë, the monstrously adulterous
Cretan queen; Phaedra, trying her wiles on her sinless stepson;
Hippolytus, over-chaste votary of the maiden-goddess
Artemis; King Pentheus murdered, for scoffing at the Dionysiac
mysteries; his mother, Agave, carries his severed
head aloft in Bacchic frenzy. To these has not been given
the true neo-Pythagorean vision of the truth; they are
portrayed here to symbolize their doom to a private Hell
of their own making.</p>

<p>Two long panels on either side of the spring of the
central vault reinforce the general intellectual tone. In
one, schoolboys recite their lessons before a seated schoolmaster
with a ferule in his hand. In the other, the Muse
of Tragedy attends the coming-of-age ceremony of a Roman
adolescent. (Some interpret this scene as a marriage;
if so, the sect will have allegorized it in some way.) We
know that the sect was open to both sexes; reliefs in the
wall-panels of the basilica show men and women making
offerings.</p>

<p>The stuccoes of the vault were in excellent condition
when found. (They have since suffered from dampness,
now being corrected by air-conditioning.) Also, they show
no traces of addition or repairs, but the wall-panels were
desecrated in antiquity by vandals, the consoles for offerings
ripped off, the lamps and chapel gear carried away. It
looks as though the chapel had had a short life, and the
cult a violent end. Will history provide a date? Tacitus
mentions in his <i>Annals</i> a rich Roman, Titus Statilius Taurus,
known to have owned property near the basilica, who fell
foul of Claudius, was accused of practicing <i>magicas superstitiones</i>,
and escaped his sentence by committing suicide
in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 53. The style of the stuccoes fits this date, the décor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
of the basilica fits the cult, its state when found fits Tacitus’
story. We may suppose that everything within reach was
looted, the chamber filled in, and probably never seen again
until the spring day 1864 years later when the landslide by
the railway revealed its existence.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In 1907 the German archaeologist F. Weege, following
in the footsteps of Renaissance explorers of 1488, made his
way through a hole in the wall of the Baths of Trajan, near
the Coliseum, to find himself in a labyrinth of underground
vaulted corridors and rooms partly filled with rubble, which
had once been part of an Imperial palace, the Golden House
of Nero. Setting lighted candles at every turning to guide
his way back, he explored as many as he could of the
eighty-eight rooms of this small part of the palace-complex,
sometimes crawling with lighted candle over rubble that
filled a room nearly to the vault, while spiders and centipedes,
and other nameless creatures scuttled away from
him into the darkness.</p>

<p>The rooms had been filled with rubble by Trajan, with
a twofold purpose: to make a firm substructure for his
baths, and to continue the work of the Flavians in damning
the memory of the conspicuous consumption and conspicuous
waste of the hated Nero. Thirteen hundred and eighty-four
years later, when the underground rooms were rediscovered,
among the visitors was Raphael, who decorated
a loggia in the Vatican Palace in the style of the fantastic
paintings on Nero’s walls. Since the buried rooms were
grottoes, the paintings were “grotesques”—as often, the
word has survived, while its history has been forgotten.
Other visitors were Caravaggio, Velasquez, Michelangelo,
and Raphael’s teacher, Perugino. The names of many a
famous artist are scrawled right across the face of the ornaments
of the vaults. An Italian poem, written not long
after the discovery of America, speaks of artists’ underground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
picnics in the Golden House. The picnickers crawled
on their bellies to enjoy their subterranean meal of bread,
ham, apples, and wine.</p>

<p>The result of Weege’s more scientific investigation was
the working out of a new plan. The western half of the
complex (<a href="#ip_7_11">Fig. 7.11</a>) proved to be conventional, with the
rooms grouped about a peristyle with garden and fountain.
Rooms 37 and 43 have alcoves: it is easy to imagine them
as the Imperial bedchambers of Nero and his beautiful red-haired
wife Poppaea. In Nero’s bedchamber were hung the
1808 gold crowns he won in athletic competitions in Greece,
if competitions they can be called, when all the prizes were
awarded to Nero in advance, and armed guards drove off
all would-be rivals.</p>

<p>The eastern wing (<a href="#ip_7_12">Fig. 7.12</a>) is more unorthodox in
plan, and more interesting. The main approach opened into
Room 60, the Hall of the Gilded Vault, so called from the
ornate painted stucco ceiling, divided into round and rectangular
fields in gilt, green, red and blue, depicting mythological
and erotic scenes, very different in tone from the
restraint of the subterranean basilica. Hippolytus, off to the
hunt, receives a letter containing incestuous proposals from
his stepmother Phaedra. Satyrs rape nymphs, Venus languishes
in the arms of Mars, Cupid rides in a chariot drawn
by panthers. And yet we are told that the painting in this
pleasure dome was done by the solemn dean of Roman
artists, Fabullus himself, the John Singer Sargent of his
day, who always painted in full dress, wearing his toga.</p>

<p>Room 70 is a vaulted corridor 227 feet long, with sixteen
windows opening to the north in the impost of the vault,
which is painted sky-blue as a <i>trompe d’oeil</i>. Seabeasts,
candelabra, and arabesques, sphinxes with shrubs growing
out of their backs, griffins, centaurs, acanthus-leaves, Cupids,
gorgons’ heads, lions’ heads with rings in their mouths,
dolphins holding horns of plenty, winged horses, eagles,
tritons, swags of flowers make up the riotous décor. In recesses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
in the walls landscapes and seascapes, impressionistically
painted, attempt the illusion of the out-of-doors.
Halfway down the corridor the vault is lowered. Here it
supported a ramp which led to the gardens above.</p>

<p>Room 84 is octagonal, lighted by a hole in the roof, anticipating,
as we shall see, Hadrian’s Pantheon. Perhaps
this was the state dining room, described by ancient sources
as hung on an axis and revolving like the world. Its ivory
ceilings slid back and dropped flowers and perfumes on
Nero’s guests.</p>

<p>The most controversial room of all is the apsidal number
80, decorated with scenes from the Trojan war: Hector and
Andromache, Paris and Helen, Thetis bringing Achilles his
shield. Nero was fascinated by the Trojan War: it was an
epic of his own composition on the fall of Troy that he
recited as Rome was burning. What was in the apse? Equivocal
Renaissance reports place the finding of the Vatican
Laocoön somewhere in this area, the apse is of a size to fit
the statue, and the subject is appropriate to a room full of
Trojan motifs. The statue’s baroque quality would have
appealed strongly to Nero’s taste. This is the circumstantial
evidence for room 80 as the findspot of one of the most
notorious statues of antiquity. That this survey of the Julio-Claudian
age should approach its end, as it began, with
mention of the Laocoön, suggests how conventional was
the repertory of Roman taste.</p>

<p>But a description of the rooms of the Golden House is
not quite the whole story. In 1954 the Dutch archaeologist
C. C. Van Essen published the results of careful probing
in the whole section of Rome for half a mile around the Coliseum,
where he found traces of Nero’s palace in a number of
places on the perimeter. For the Golden House was much
more than the complex of rooms just described. It was a gigantic
system (<a href="#ip_7_13">Fig. 7.13</a>) of parks, with lawns, groves, pastures,
a zoo. Over its central pool later rose the great bulk
of the Coliseum. Within these grounds, twice the extent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Vatican City, was a great Versailles in the midst of the
teeming metropolis. The eighty-odd rooms we have been
describing made up but one of several palaces in the
grounds. And an American, Miss E. B. Van Deman, working
from some very unlikely-looking architectural blocks piled
beside the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina in the old
Forum, was able in 1925 to restore on paper (<a href="#ip_7_14">Fig. 7.14</a>) the
monumental approach, over 350 feet wide, to the palace
grounds from the old Forum and Palatine. It was a mile
long, with arcades of luxury shops, and eight rows of pillars.
Its plan is concealed today under mounds of dumped earth
between the Hall of the Vestals and the Arch of Titus. Beside
it rose a colossal statue of Nero, 120 feet tall, now
marked by a pattern in the pavement. When Hadrian desired
to remove the statue to make room for his Temple of
Venus and Rome, it took twenty-four elephants to do the
job. But decades before, his predecessors the Flavians had
done what they could, with the Baths of Titus and the Flavian
Amphitheater (the proper name of the Coliseum) to
erase the memory of Nero’s monstrous extravagance, and
turn his palace grounds to public use.</p>

<p>The four archaeological examples from the Julio-Claudian
age discussed in this chapter were chosen for their intrinsic
interest, not to illustrate a thesis. But they do prove a point
all the same. Tiberius’ <i>al fresco</i> dining room, with its monstrous
and tortured statuary (even though some of it be
later in date); Caligula’s houseboats, with their incredibly
heavy profusion of work in colored marble, mosaic, and
bronze; Nero’s Golden House, with its labyrinth of gaudy
and over-decorated rooms of state, all testify to a decadent
extravagance beyond Hollywood’s wildest aspirations. By
comparison, the cool, quiet taste of the subterranean basilica
is an oasis and a relief, but even this is a commentary on
Claudius’ intolerance. And it has about it an air of holier-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>than-thou
Brahminism, the furthest possible contrast with
the warmth, the close contact with common people, which
marked the Christianity that was to be preached in Rome
not long after the basilica-sect was outlawed. One cannot
but marvel at the staying-power of the organism that could
survive this prodigality, this cleavage between class and
mass, for over three centuries. But as we focus our attention
upon the excesses of court and of metropolis, we ought not
to forget that in the municipal towns of Italy and the Empire
life went on, more modestly, quietly, and decently.
Archaeology gives us precious proof of this in a pair of
buried cities of the Flavian Age, Pompeii and Herculaneum.</p>

<span class="subhead">The Victims of Vesuvius</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One day in 1711 a peasant digging a well on his property
in Resina, on the bay five miles southeast of Naples, came
upon a level of white and polychrome architectural marbles,
obviously ancient. This chance find led to the discovery of
what proved to be the buried town of Herculaneum, destroyed
in the eruption of Vesuvius of August 24, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 79.
Workmen digging in 1748 by the Sarno canal, nine miles
farther along the bay, found bronzes and marbles on a
site which an inscription, discovered fifteen years later,
identified as Herculaneum’s more famous sister city, Pompeii.
Thus began a saga of excavation which has told the
modern world more about ancient life than any other dig
in the long history of archaeology, and this in two towns
which have left almost no record in literature. In a few
hours of a summer afternoon the eruption stopped the life
of two flourishing little cities dead in its tracks: dinner on
the tables, the wine-shops crowded, sacrifices at the moment
of being offered, funerals in progress, prisoners in the
stocks, watchdogs on their chains. The townsfolk had not
even time to gather their possessions. Ironically, going back
for their little hoards of gold and silver spelled death for
many of them, under the hail of pumice-stone and ashes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
(or, at Herculeaneum, the river of lava) which asphyxiated
(<a href="#ip_8_1">Fig. 8.1</a>) or engulfed them. At Herculaneum, on the afternoon
of the eruption, rain turned the volcanic ash to mud,
which solidified, burying the town thirty to forty feet deep.
Electric drills and mechanical shovels are needed to dig
there, so progress has been slow. Even Pompeii, under its
shallower layer of pumice-pebbles and light ash, is still only
about three-fifths excavated.</p>

<p>(V. Spinazzola, <i>Pompeii: ... Via dell’ Abbondanza</i>, 1, p. 443)</p></div></div>

<p>For a century and a half after their rediscovery the two
sites were treated almost entirely as a quarry for works of
art, as a plaything for the various dynasties that misruled
Naples, and as a romantic stop on the Grand Tour. The
discovery of ancient artifacts here revolutionized the taste
of Europe: Ludwig of Bavaria built a replica of a Pompeian
house at Aschaffenburg; Winckelmann, the great Romantic
art historian, conceived here many of his notions of
the wonders of Greek art; Casanova’s brother copied some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
of the paintings, and did a brisk business in forgeries. Nelson’s
mistress, Lady Hamilton, was a frequent visitor: her
husband was British ambassador to Naples. Goethe was
impressed by Pompeii’s smallness; Napoleon’s marshal Murat
supervised the dig, and Garibaldi made Alexandre
Dumas his Director of Antiquities here. A generation of
Victorians sobbed over <i>The Last Days of Pompeii</i>, and the
young Queen herself visited the Site in 1838.</p>

<p>But it was not till the era of scientific archaeology—which
came to Pompeii and Herculaneum with Fiorelli in 1860—that
the buried cities began to add their never-ceasing
stores to the sum of our knowledge of ancient town-planning,
public life, private life in town and country houses,
trade and tradesmen, religion, and art.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 8.3</span> Pompeii, plan. (MPI)</div></div>

<p>One of the results of scientific excavation at Pompeii was
to reveal at last the town plan (<a href="#ip_8_2">Fig. 8.2</a>), after decades
spent in sporadic digging for treasure trove, in cutting paintings
out of walls, filling in the excavated houses, and moving
on without system to a new area. The plan as now
revealed (<a href="#ip_8_3">Fig. 8.3</a>) shows the least regular streets in the
southwest quadrant of the town around the Forum; this,
therefore, should be the oldest part; and in fact architectural
terracottas found here, in the so-called <i>Foro triangolare</i>,
are dated in the sixth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Elsewhere the pattern
of a rectangular grid is clear, making possible the
division of the city for purposes of archaeological reference
into nine regions. Each region is subdivided into numbered
blocks, or <i>insulae</i>; each <i>insula</i> into numbered houses. The
whole 160 acres, big enough for a population of from fifteen
to twenty thousand, is surrounded by a wall, in which archaeologists,
on the basis of building materials and techniques,
have detected four phases. The earliest, with a facing
of squared limestone, dates from the fifth century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>;
the latest, marked by the addition of high towers, from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
time of Sulla, who settled some of his veterans here in a
colony grandiosely named the <i>Colonia Veneria Cornelia
Pompeianorum</i>. Masons’ marks from the third phase (280–180
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>) are in Oscan letters, the alphabet of ancient Italy’s
major language, next after Latin and Greek. Inscriptions
(street signs for example) show that Oscan persisted as
Pompeii’s third language, along with Latin and Greek (for
the area around Naples had originally been settled by
Greeks, and they kept their culture), down almost to the
time of the eruption. The wall shows the marks of the stone
catapult-balls of the Sullan siege; some of the balls were
found preserved as souvenirs in houses. After the Sullan
phase the wall was allowed to fall into disrepair, mute evidence
of the security of the Augustan peace.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Whatever curtailment of liberty seemed a price worth
paying for security in Rome, Pompeii at least enjoyed an
active political life. The evidence is a vast series of election
“posters,” painted in red and black on house and shop walls.
In these, individuals and groups (for example, the fullers
or laundrymen, the fruit-vendors, the fishermen, dyers, bakers,
goldsmiths, muleteers, and a private club of gay blades
who call themselves the <i>seribibi</i>, late drinkers) urge their
fellow-citizens to vote for candidates for aedile, the highest
municipal office. For one block of supporters the candidate’s
gratitude must have been extremely limited: the notice
read: “The sneak-thieves support Vatia for the aedileship.”
The bases for the invitations to vote for a candidate like
“Vote for <i>X</i>: he won’t squander public funds,” will have a
strong appeal for the modern reader.</p>

<p>There was no interference with due process, to judge by
the basilica in the Forum, where Pompeii’s legal business
was transacted: it is Pompeii’s largest and most important
public building. Tiles found in it stamped in Oscan come
from a level which shows that the building dates at least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
from 120 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Across the Forum from the basilica is the
<i>comitium</i>, for town meetings and elections: at the south
end of the Forum are three buildings, identified as the
meeting-place of the town council, with municipal offices
on either side.</p>

<p>Pompeii was well-supplied, too, with public amenities.
The streets were paved, and supplied at the main intersections
with stepping stones, which did not interfere with the
passage of high-axled wagons, though some stepping stones
were removed in 1815 to allow the Queen of Naples’ coach
to pass. (Nowadays visitors with a taste for ostentation can
be carried through Pompeii in a sedan chair.) Lead water-pipes
found everywhere show that all but the very humblest
houses were supplied with running water. There were
no less than three sets of public baths, of which the largest
was under construction when the catastrophe came. The
baths had radiant heating and elegant stuccoed vaults.
There were separate sets of rooms for men and for women,
and an enormous number of lamps found in one establishment
shows that it was in use also in the evening hours.</p>

<p>That the intellectual as well as the physical needs of the
population were catered to is deduced from the existence
of two stone theaters, one open to the sky, with a capacity
of 5,000; one roofed, a <i>théatre intime</i>, for about 800. Both
antedate the earliest stone theater in Rome. But the Pompeians
did not push the intellectual life to extremes. The
portico behind the large theater was remodelled in Nero’s
reign to make a barracks for gladiators, complete with
armory and lock-up, where three of them were found asphyxiated
in the stocks. The amphitheater has seats for
20,000. Legends scrawled on its walls, and on house-walls
all over town, testify to the gladiators’ popularity with their
fans: gladiatorial records are registered (twenty-four fights,
twenty-four victories; the losers most often are murdered
and forgotten), and one champion is recorded as <i>SVSPIRIVM
PVELLARVM</i>, the one the girls sigh for.</p>

<p>But Pompeii’s greatest contribution is to our knowledge,
almost indecently intimate, of the private life of its inhabitants.
This information comes primarily from the town
houses and the suburban and rustic villas. The best guidebooks
go into some detail on seventy-eight of these in Pompeii,
and thirty-one in Herculaneum; hundreds more go
unrecorded. In the face of this <i>embarras de richesse</i>, rigorous
selection is necessary, and a description of a few houses
and villas must suffice. To represent town houses I choose
the “House of the Moralist” (<i>Regio</i> III, <i>Insula</i> iv, House
2–3), on the Via dell’ Abbondanza, a shopping street of
average houses. (The aristocratic quarter was in <i>Regio</i> VI.)
Excavations on this street by Vittorio Spinazzola between
1910 and 1923 were carried out according to a method
new in Pompeii, which made the dead street come alive
with extraordinary vividness. Spinazzola’s meticulousness
preserved and reconstructed the traces of upper stories,
with windows, balconies, and loggias; of gardens, with the
discovered roots of their trees and plants replaced by modern
ones of the same species. The colorful painted signs
and notices on the house and shop fronts, instead of being
detached as in the past and transferred to the museum in
Naples, were left <i>in situ</i>, protected by glass and awnings,
and the house interiors, with their furniture and wall-paintings,
were kept intact. All this Spinazzola published in
1953 in a colossal book of 1110 folio pages, with over 1000
figures and ninety-six large plates. His account is the more
important because the House of the Moralist, having been
kept inviolate by volcanic ashes for so many centuries, was
badly damaged by Allied bombs in 1943. (There were
Germans quartered in the hotels near the excavation entrance.)
The ground floor plan (Figs. <a href="#ip_8_4">8.4</a> and <a href="#ip_8_5">8.5</a>) of that
house shows two dwellings thrown into one. The smaller,
on the left, has typical features: its vestibule leading to an
<i>atrium</i> or patio off which open a summer and a winter dining
room and a light-well planted with flowers and shrubs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
The winter dining-room is frescoed in glossy black; it has
a vaulted, coffered ceiling, and a high window closed by
a shutter planned to slide into the wall. The usual peristyle,
or rectangular portico behind the <i>atrium</i>, is missing, its
function supplied by the loggias on the upper floor and
the large sunken garden behind the larger house. The garden
was planned as a little grove sacred to Diana. Her
statue was found in the middle of the garden, with a little
bronze incense-burner in the shape of a ram still in place
on its pedestal, and large trees planted around it. The
pleasant summer dining room fills the garden’s southwest
corner. In it the marble-topped table was found set for a
meal or sacrifice (<a href="#ip_8_6">Fig. 8.6</a>). In the corner was a brazier and
a pitcher for hot water. Three couplets painted on the wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
prescribed etiquette for the diners, and give the house its
name: “Don’t put your dirty feet on our couch covers; if
you bicker at table you’ll have to go home; be modest and
don’t make eyes at another man’s wife.” There was a dumb-waiter
to serve the pleasant loggias on the upper floor overlooking
the garden. The pointed jars, amphorae, in the basement,
suggest that the Moralist was a wine merchant. A
stamp found there gives his name: Gaius Arrius Crescens.
Election notices painted on the house front show that he
and his family were up to their ears in local politics.</p>

<p>A sumptuous suburban dwelling is the sixty-room Villa
of the Mysteries outside Pompeii’s Herculaneum gate, the
noblest and grandest known of its kind. It was built on a
seaward-facing slope, with a terrace and subterranean
vaults. A careful analysis by its excavator, Amedeo Maiuri,
of its building materials and décor shows six phases, of
which the earliest, in squared blocks of local limestone,
includes the rectangular block of rooms numbered 2–8 and
11–21 in the plan (<a href="#ip_8_7">Fig. 8.7</a>), and is dated 200–150 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> At
this stage the villa was surrounded on three sides by a
pleasant open portico, and the curved exedra or belvedere
(see the plan) did not yet exist. The next stage is marked
by the use of handsome light gray tufa instead of limestone,
includes the peristyle and small <i>atrium</i> (<i>atriolum</i> in the
plan), and the modest bathing rooms (42–44) beyond. It
dates from the time of Sulla. The next two periods are
dated from the prevalent styles of wall-painting, to be discussed
in the section on art below. They take the villa’s
building history through the reign of Augustus. In the Julio-Claudian
period—the date is again made precise by the style
of painting—the villa became useful as well as ornamental:
the rustic quarters 52–60 were added, and an upper floor
overlooking the vestibule. The latter is more elegant than
the rustic quarters, less so than the noble eastern rooms.
The inference is that in this period the owner used the villa
only occasionally, leaving the management of its business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
end to a resident factor who lived on the upper floor (see
the reconstruction, <a href="#ip_8_8">Fig. 8.8</a>) where he could keep his eye
on the bailiff and the slave farm-hands. The portico (P 1–4)
was now provided with a windowed wall between its columns,
and the sunrooms (9–10) were created, with their
splendid view, open to the southern sunshine, ideal for
a winter siesta.</p>

<p>(A. Maiuri, <i>La Villa dei Misteri</i>, p. 41)</p></div></div>

<p>When the volcano finally struck, the villa was undergoing
extensive remodelling, having apparently not yet recovered
from an earlier catastrophe for which there is other
evidence, both archaeological and literary: an earthquake
in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 62. The master’s quarters were found empty of their
contents, as though after the earthquake he had moved
out altogether, and sold his elegant furniture at auction.
A stamp reveals the name of the new owner: Lucius Istacidius
Zosimus. Istacidius is a noble Samnite (Oscan)
name; Zosimus is Creek. The inference is that the new
owner was a freedman of the former master, who bought
up the property and turned the entire establishment into
a farmhouse. Evidence of the tasteless change from elegance
to stark practicality was found everywhere: piles of
mortar, columns and architraves taken down and stored,
rooms closed off, an ugly new wall run straight across one
of the most tasteful rooms in the master’s quarters (6), a
heap of onions piled on a mosaic floor in an alcoved master
bedroom, farm tools in the graceful southwest sunroom (9).
The apsidal room (25) was apparently destined to become
a shrine to the Emperor. In it the statue of Augustus’ consort,
the Empress Livia, in painted marble with the head
inserted in a second-hand torso (which was found [<a href="#ip_8_9">Fig. 8.9</a>]
propped against the peristyle wall) was apparently to
be set up.</p>

<p>On the rustic side of the villa, business was going on as
usual. The winepress (<a href="#ip_8_10">Fig. 8.10</a>) was ready for use in the
coming vintage; rough wine was ready in large amphorae
protected by woven straw like a modern <i>fiascone</i> of Chianti<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
or Vesuvio. Farm tools (picks, hoe, shovel, hammer, pruning
hooks) were found hanging in a room (32) beside the
vestibule. The porter was on duty. He was found dead in
his dark little room (35), on his finger a cheap iron ring
set with an engraved carnelian, by his side the five bronze
coins which may have been his life savings. He must have
heard the dying screams of the adolescent girl whose skeleton
was found in the vestibule nearby. Three women were
crushed in the rustic quarters (55) when the roof fell in.
The excavators found their disordered skeletons, their gold
rings and bracelets, a necklace of gold and glass paste beads,
and, lying nearby, ten silver coins. In the cryptoporticus
were found the bodies of four men, with wine or water
jugs by their side. They had hoped the sturdy vaults would
hold, and they did, but the mephitic fumes proved deadly.
(Altogether, it is calculated that Vesuvius claimed 2,000
victims in Pompeii.) The nine wretched cadavers in the
Villa of the Mysteries were the last inhabitants of a mansion
which in its day had been one of the most elegant in
all Italy.</p>

<p>Though space does not permit a detailed account of the
fascinating things Herculaneum has to tell us, the subject
of suburban villas cannot be left without mentioning a
famous one there, still not fully explored, where in 1752
were found, in a narrow room with cupboards, a vast number
of what were at first taken for charred billets of wood.
Later, traces of writing were found on them: they turned
out to be papyri, a whole library of 1800 rolls. A machine
invented to unroll them ruined more scrolls than it unwound,
but finally, by 1806, ninety-six were deciphered.
They proved to be works of an Epicurean philosopher
named Philodemus, to whose patron Lucius Calpurnius
Piso (father of Caesar’s wife Calpurnia) and his descendants
the villa may have belonged. It had a gracious peristyle,
gardens, fishponds, and a belvedere overlooking the
sea at the end of a long graveled walk. In the garden was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
found a whole gallery of sculpture in bronze and marble,
now included among the most famous pieces in the National
Museum in Naples. Here a cultured Roman patrician could
combine in the ideal Epicurean way the calm contemplation
of the beauties of nature and of art with the philosophic
study of the atomic structure of the universe.</p>

<p>A more rustic villa, between Pompeii and Boscoreale to
the north, shows what the establishment of a capital farmer
of the first century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> was like. The owner’s quarters were
modest. Business came first: most of the ground floor is
taken up with stable, wine and oil presses, threshing floor,
and slaves’ quarters. Slaves were a problem: one rustic
villa has quarters for thirty and stocks for fourteen. The
Boscoreale wine store had a 23,000 gallon capacity, and
enough stone jars were found to hold 1,300 gallons of olive
oil. The proprietor of this villa, however, was not without
his fondness for aesthetic ostentation. In a wine vat here
was found in 1895 a treasure of 108 embossed silver vessels
and 1000 gold coins. They were bought by the banker
Count Edward de Rothschild, much to Italian disgust, and
presented to the Louvre. One pair of cups represents a
series of skeletons, one garlanded, another with a heavy bag
of money, a third with a roll of papyrus, a fourth with a
lyre; the whole bears the legend, the tragic irony of which
the proprietor of the villa was to discover: “Seize hold on
life; tomorrow is uncertain.” Another treasure in silver,
of 118 pieces, all now securely in the Naples museum, was
discovered in 1930 in a nail-studded chest in the strong
room under a town house (I.x.4) called the “House of the
Menander” after a fresco of the dramatist on the walls.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But it is not only the nabobs, their villas, and their treasures
which Pompeii reveals to us. Ancient tradesmen, their
lives, work, and tastes, about which literature tells us almost
nothing, become more real for us here than anywhere else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
in the ancient world except Ostia. In the market facing the
Forum the excavators found fruit in glass containers, and
the skeletons of fish and sheep. There are inns for muleteers
and carters by the city gates, and innumerable wine shops,
the bar open to the street, its top pierced to hold cool
amphorae of wine or covered bronze vessels for hot drinks
(<a href="#ip_8_11">Fig. 8.11</a>). Wine prices are scratched on walls, together
with other <i>graffiti</i> of more or less extreme indecency, referring
usually to the oldest of the professions. One says,
“I am yours—for two <i>asses</i>” (the <i>as</i> was a small copper coin
worth, at the time this <i>graffito</i> was scribbled, about two-and-a-half
cents). Another, in large letters over a bench
at the Porta Marina, advises loungers to READ THIS SIGN
FIRST, and offers the charms of a Greek prostitute named
Attiké at sixteen <i>asses</i>. This sort of thing prompted the
more sober-sided Pompeians to write more than once on
the walls (of the large theater, amphitheater, and basilica)
the couplet, one of the most famous of the hundreds found
at Pompeii:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="iq">“<i>I wonder, wall, that you do not go smash,</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who have to bear the weight of all this trash!</i>”<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Other <i>graffiti</i> complain of unrequited love: “I’d like to bash
Venus’ ribs in” (from the basilica), or “Here Vibius lay
alone and longed for his beloved” (perhaps from an inn).
Snatches from the love-poets, Ovid and (strangely) the
tortured, neurotic Propertius, are frequent, and tags of
Vergil remembered from schooldays. <i>Graffiti</i> keep a running
account of daily purchases of cheese, bread, oil, and
wine; or the number of eggs laid daily by the chickens. A
reward is offered for the recovery of a stolen bronze pitcher.
Income property is advertised for rent, or gentlemen’s upstairs
flats (<i>cenacula equestria</i>). A metal worker, doing a
brisk business in chamber pots, has scratched on his wall
a memo of the days fairs are held in nearby towns. He made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
surveyors’ instruments as well: our only example of a surveyor’s
plane table (<i>groma</i>) comes from his shop. In a
bronze-bound chest in the house of a rich freedman banker,
Lucius Caecilius Jucundus, were found his complete (and
involved) accounts, on 153 wax tablets. His bronze bust,
with its shrewd, ugly, kindly face, warts and all (<a href="#ip_8_12">Fig. 8.12</a>),
was also found in the house. It reveals the very type of the
<i>nouveaux riches</i>, not in the least ashamed of being “in
trade,” who came to be the ruling class in the last days of
Pompeii.</p>

<p>The wealth of tradesmen can be judged by the quality
of the decoration of their houses, in which they often plied
their trade, for the ancient world’s slave economy did not
foster the factory system. Thus in the house of the jeweler
Pinarius Cerialis (III,iv,4), his showcase was found containing
fine engraved cornelians, agates, and amethysts, some
of the work unfinished, and also the tiny, delicate tools of
his trade. In the House of the Surgeon (VI.1,9–10) surgical
instruments were found, including probes, catheters, gynaecological
forceps, pliers for pulling teeth, and little spoons,
perhaps for extracting wax from the ears. These provide
our best evidence for ancient surgical techniques.</p>

<p>Stephanus’ <i>fullonica</i> (laundry: I.vi.7) was found with
the imprint of the fallen front door left clearly in the ashes.
The padlock was on the outside, from which the inference
is that this establishment served as laundry only; if it had
been a dwelling, the lock would have been on the inside. A
skeleton behind the door had with him a bag of 107 gold
and silver coins. Since two-thirds of them had been minted
years before, under the Republic, one assumes that this was
not merely the day’s take, but a hoard; all the shop’s moveable
capital. Built in at the back were the small vats where
the dirty clothes were trodden, to get out the dirt and
grease, and the larger ones for rinsing. The upper floor and
courtyard were used for drying: in the courtyard wall were
found the small putholes for the canes over which the wet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
clothes were hung. Near the entrance was the clothes press,
in which a pressing board was worked down upon the folded
clothes by means of a pair of large wooden screws.</p>

<p>Across the street from the laundry a painted shop front
shows the operations of a felter’s establishment, where wool
was matted together with a fixative, under repeated manipulation
and pressure, until it acquired a consistent texture,
like a piece of cloth. Felt was in demand for caps, cloaks,
slippers, and blankets (the latter for both man and horse).
The shop sign shows workmen at tables holding the carding
comb and knives of their trade. In the middle of the picture
other men, naked to the waist, are at work at shallow troughs
impregnating the wool with the coagulant (Pliny the Elder
says it was vinegar) which is being heated by a stove beneath
the troughs. To the right, the proprietor—his name
was Verecundus—proudly holds up a red-striped finished
sample. To the left, Mercury, the patron of tradesmen, is
painted emerging from a Tuscan temple with a money bag
in his hand (“Hurrah for profit,” says a Pompeian <i>graffito</i>).
Below is the proprietor’s wife at a table, in spirited conversation
with a female customer who is trying on slippers.
No literary discussion, primary or secondary, can match the
vivid concreteness of this archaeological record.</p>

<p>The house (II.v.1–4) of Decimus Octavius Quartio (or
Marcus Loreius Tiburtinus—authorities differ about the occupant’s
name) belonged to a potter, to judge by a small
kiln, with the potter’s stool and samples of his wares, found
in a workroom. This is interesting enough, but more interesting
still is this tradesman’s taste, as revealed by his house
and garden. Hardly a corner of the house is left unfrescoed,
and the paintings include two ambitious cycles; nine episodes
from the saga of Hercules, and fourteen from the
<i>Iliad</i>. (The House of the Cryptoporticus [I.vi.2–4] presents
twenty-five <i>Iliad</i> episodes from an original 86, badly damaged
when the last owner, an obvious Babbitt, turned the
cryptoporticus into a wine cellar and made over the dining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
room for public use.) The potter was besides a connoisseur
of gardens; his is the most charming that Pompeii can boast.
His <i>impluvium</i>—for catching rainwater in the <i>atrium</i> (courtyard
or patio)—is double-walled, for flower-boxes; behind
the <i>atrium</i> is a formal flower bed, with walks around it on
three sides; the chief feature of the sunken back garden
(<a href="#ip_8_13">Fig. 8.13</a>), nearly twice the area of the house itself, is a
pair of long narrow fish pools, planned perpendicular to
each other to form a T, and trellised (<a href="#ip_8_14">Fig. 8.14</a>) so that
vines could grow over them. The walls of the pools were
painted blue to deepen the color of the water. At one end
of the crossbar of the T is the pleasantest <i>al fresco</i> dining
alcove imaginable. Statuettes embellish the alcove and the
sides of the pool. There is a little shrine in the alcove; another,
with a fountain, where the two pools meet; still
another, with a fountain in front of it, two-thirds of the way
along the upright of the T. Putholes in the garden wall show
that there were shed roofs there to protect exotic plants
and flowers. The plum trees, oaks, shrubs, arbors, and plants
with which the garden was filled in orderly rows, with
walks between, have been replanted, after identifying them
from their roots found in the ashes. Forty-four amphorae
were found buried to their necks in a row along one side
of the garden. Perhaps they served as flower pots; it is
equally possible that they were a wine store, for this potter’s
house has no wine cellar. In a corner and under the
arbors along the walks there were wooden seats and little
marble tables, for rustic picnics in the pleached shade. The
difference of levels, the fountains, shrines, statues, arbors,
trees, and the painted colors, red, gray, green, yellow, and
blue, all judiciously restored, make this age-old garden
extraordinarily vivacious. Here archaeology has once more
given the lie to the hackneyed stereotype of the lifelessness
and colorlessness of classical antiquity, and has proved that
in landscape-gardening, at any rate, there is something to
be said for the <i>bourgeois</i> taste of Pompeian tradesmen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
Some had a taste for music, too, to judge by some frescoes
in the small but gracious House of Fabia (I.vi.15). One
portrays the mistress of the house with sheet music in her
hand. Another shows what appears to be a music lesson,
our only example of the lyre being played four hands. Indeed
archaeology, by revealing these middlebrows to us
in three dimensions, their shops and artifacts, inns and bars,
street signs and <i>graffiti</i>, loves licit and illicit, tools and
equipment, their tastes and pleasures, has given us, especially
in Pompeii, a truer picture of the average, ordinary ancient
Italian man than Latin literature provides. For Latin literature,
with some exceptions like Plautus’ plays, tends to be
written by highbrows for highbrows. (Yet paradoxically, the
best literary picture of an ancient Babbitt, Petronius’ Trimalchio,
<i>was</i> drawn by a highbrow for highbrows.)</p>

<p>Pompeii has enriched, too, our knowledge of the ancient
Italian’s relation to his gods. The archaeological documents
for Pompeian religion include the temples, innumerable
household shrines, wayside altars, frescoes, inscriptions, and
<i>graffiti</i>. Of the ten temples, three, ruined in the earthquake,
had not been repaired at the time of the final débacle,
seventeen years later. One had reverted to the use of a
private association, and two were dedicated to the Imperial
cult, to which generally only lip service was paid. One piece
of evidence on this is the cynical <i>graffito</i> from a farm in
nearby Boscotrecase: “Augustus Caesar’s mother was only
a woman.” Of the rest, only the temple of the Egyptian Isis
shows real signs of the prosperity that comes from devout
support. The truth is that the real god of Pompeii—as of
most other cities ancient and modern—was the God of Gain.
The state religion, cold and formal, offered little comfort:
the warmth and promise came from Oriental religions, of
which Isis-worship was one and Christianity another. There
is no evidence of Christianity’s having penetrated Pompeii
by <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 79, unless the ominous <i>graffito</i>, “SODOMA, GO<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>MORA,”
be taken as a sign. But Pompeii, close to the
Italian end of the trade-route from Alexandria, is permeated
with things Egyptian, and there is much evidence of enthusiasm
for the cult of Isis. The earliest building stones of
the temple (VII.vii) belong to the end of the second century
<span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and were thrown down in the earthquake of <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 62.
But <i>this</i> temple was not left derelict: it was immediately
reconstructed from the ground up in the name of a six-year-old
boy, who was rewarded for his piety by honorary membership
in the town council. The cult, with its promise of
personal immortality, received rich gifts from its votaries.
Its marble lustral basin, for holy water; statues and statuettes,
including of course the goddess herself, with her rattle that
kept off evil spirits; the striking bronze bust of an actor-donor;
lamps; sacrificial knives; the ornamental marble curb
of a well; candelabra, and rich frescoes, some with likenesses
of white-robed, shaven-headed priests, which decorated the
precinct and the walls, are now among the treasures of the
National Museum in Naples.</p>

<p>Family cults flourished in Pompeii more than the official
religion, to judge by the fact that nearly every house and
workshop has its private shrine, usually housing busts of
ancestors (for in this the Romans were downright Japanese),
and adorned with a picture of a snake, representing the
family’s Genius, or guardian spirit. Sometimes, as in the
House of the Cryptoporticus, there is a handsomely decorated
private shrine to one of the Olympian deities, in this
case Diana. The trades had their patron saints: Mercury
(god also of thieves) for commerce; Minerva, who invented
weaving, for the clothmakers; the hearth goddess Vesta for
the bakers. The front of the felter’s shop described above is
emblazoned with a magnificent Venus in a chariot drawn
by four elephants. Sex, too, had its enthusiastic worshipers:
a dyer’s vat (IX.vii.2) bears a relief of an enormous winged
phallus, set in a temple whose <i>acroteria</i> are also phalluses,
of smaller size. But perhaps the perfect symbol of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
religion of this tradesmen’s town is a fresco in the House
of the Cryptoporticus, in which the family of Aeneas (the
symbol of Rome) is shown guided to its destiny by Mercury,
the god of trade.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Is all this great art? A fair answer to the question should
come from an analysis of what is usually regarded as the
masterpiece of Pompeian painting, the fresco in Room 5 of
the Villa of the Mysteries.</p>

<p>This analysis must be prefaced by a word about the four
more or less successive styles into which archaeologists have
succeeded in dividing the vast corpus of Pompeian painting.
The First (or “incrustation”) Style, found in buildings (<i>e.g.</i>,
at Palestrina) dated by their fabric and technique from
150 to 80 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, uses colored stucco to imitate marble dadoes,
rusticated blocks, and revetments. The Second (or “architectural”)
Style (80 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>-<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 14) imitates architectural
forms, uses perspective, and throws the field to be painted
open to mythical or religious subjects. The Third (or
“Egyptianizing”) Style (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 14–62) flattens out painted
architectural detail into painted “surrounds” or frames for
panels which look like hanging tapestries, worked out with
fine detail in a miniaturist’s technique. The Fourth (or
“ornamental”) Style (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 62–79) features infinite vistas,
with figures moving amid fantastic architecture. Examples
of the last three styles are frequent in the Villa of the
Mysteries, but the great sequence from which the Villa takes
its name is of the Second Style and Augustus’ reign.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 8.15</span> Pompeii, Villa of the Mysteries, fresco: woman being scourged. (MPI)</div></div>

<p>In this sequence, against a background of brilliant Pompeian
red, are painted, almost life-size, a series of twenty-nine
figures subdivided into ten groups. At the left of the
door in the northwest corner (as one enters from Room 4)
a boy reads what is apparently a ritual from a papyrus roll;
a woman, perhaps his mother, points to the words with a
stylus. Next is a scene of ritual washing of a myrtle branch;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
one of the servers, in deep décolleté, and with pointed ears,
carries the papyrus ritual roll at her waist in a fold of
her <i>stola</i>. In the next group a fat, blonde-bearded, naked
old Silenus plays a lyre, a faun plays his pipe, and his
consort gives suck to a goat. Then comes the figure of a
woman in motion so violent that her drapery swirls about
her as she raises a hand in horror at one of the scenes that
follows. But between her and the scene that repels her are
three other groups. First, another trio, of a Silenus and two
fauns. The Silenus is giving one of the fauns a drink out of
a silver bowl; the other faun frightens the drinker with a
Silenus mask held so as to be reflected in the surface of the
wine. Second, the central scene, in the center of the east
wall: a naked god, identified as Bacchus by the thyrsus (the
staff tipped with a pine cone) which lies athwart his body,
and by the vine leaves in his hair, leans back in the lap of
a figure who must be his bride, Ariadne. Third, a kneeling
woman unveils an erect purple-draped object, surely the
Mystery of Mysteries, a phallus. Beyond her is the scene of
horror (<a href="#ip_8_15">Fig. 8.15</a>): a half-naked female figure with huge
black wings raises a whip to scourge a woman, surely the
candidate for initiation, who cowers, her back bare, her face
buried, in the lap of a seated woman who strokes the victim’s
dishevelled hair to comfort her. Beyond her a naked Bacchante
whirls in an orgiastic dance, clicking castanets high
in the air above her head. In the last two scenes a woman in
bridal yellow, on an elegant ivory stool, does her hair while
a Cupid holds a mirror. Another Cupid, with his bow, looks
on. And finally, a matron, with her mantle draped over her
head like a priestess, sits, leaning on a cushion of purple and
gold, on a chair with a footstool, and watches gravely.</p>

<p>This fresco, which clearly portrays a Dionysiac ritual,
and connects it with marriage and fertility, has undeniable
power. It packs into a confined space—it is less than sixty
feet long, on three sides of a room measuring only 16 × 23
feet—movement, rest, fear, horror, magic, abandon, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
orgy. It illustrates better than anything else from Pompeii
how the Augustan age assimilated Hellenistic Greek art into
an Italian idiom. Yet somehow the final impression, here and
in lesser examples of Pompeian painting, is that the artist
is working from a memory of great paintings seen in collections
or museums, from a repertory, or from sketch books
of famous works of art. His work is well above the inn-sign
or wallpaper level, he is competent and sophisticated; no
hack, but no genius either. And so, with all respect for the
natural enthusiasm of the excavator, the question with which
this section began must be answered in the negative. This
is not great art, but it is the next thing to it, and no modern
<i>bourgeoisie</i> since the sixteenth-century Dutch has had the
taste to fill its houses with such able work. But we must
conclude that the great value of Pompeian art is in documentation,
of the practical taste of ordinary people.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Maximilian, later to be Emperor of Mexico, when he
visited Pompeii in 1851, found it terrible, its rooms like
painted corpses. Since then, modern archaeological methods
(scientific, not miraculous) have brought the corpses to
life. What archaeology has presented to us here, as at its
best it always does, is not things but people, at work and
play, in house and workshop, worshiping and blaspheming,
and after their fashion patronizing the arts. So vividly does
archaeology reveal them that we are moved to say with
Francis Bacon, “<i>These</i> are the ancient times, when the
world is ancient, and not those which we account ancient,
by a computation backwards from ourselves.”</p>

<p>As the rain of ashes was covering Pompeii, and the river
of lava engulfing Herculaneum, life in Rome, that Eternal
City, went on. It was the age of the Flavians. Vespasian, the
<i>bourgeois</i> founder of the dynasty, died just a month before
Pompeii was buried. He and his sons, the good Titus and
the wicked Domitian, enriched Rome with splendid art and
architecture.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="CHAPTER_9" class="vspace">9<br />

<span class="subhead">Flavian Rome</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Two <i>fora</i>, an amphitheater, an arch, a sculptured relief,
a palace, a stadium: these may stand as typical of archaeology’s
contributions to our knowledge of the Flavian age. As
in the Julio-Claudian dynasty, the buildings and the sculpture
epitomize the atmosphere of the time, the last three
decades of the first century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> After the excesses of Nero
and the bloodbath of <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 69—a year of civil war which saw
three Emperors in succession, Galba, Otho, and Vitellius,
raised to the purple and then murdered—the Roman people
wanted “normalcy.” Under Vespasian and Titus they got
it; under Domitian the pendulum swung again—and so did
the headsman’s ax.</p>

<p>Flavian architecture and art sum up, too, the personalities
of the Emperors. The bluff, no-nonsense Vespasian, the
Emperor of reconstruction, symbolized, in his majestic Forum
of Peace, what one of his staff called the “immense majesty”
of the peace he had brought to a war-torn world, and
Vespasian gave credit, in the frieze of the <i>Forum Transitorium</i>,
to the artisan class which was his ardent supporter.
Again, true to his <i>bourgeois</i> origins, he built for the people,
over the pool of Nero’s Golden House, the great amphitheater
which posterity was to call the Coliseum. Titus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
summed up the great moment of his short life when he
immortalized his capture of Jerusalem on his arch at the top
of the old Forum. Domitian, would-be <i>triumphator</i>, would-be
rival of his great predecessors, exalted, in the reliefs
recently found under the Cancelleria palace in Rome, the
military prowess of the dynasty which in his view culminated
in himself. He took over Vespasian’s <i>Forum Transitorium</i>,
to thrust himself into a class with Augustus and his own
father; reared on the Palatine a palace to outdo the Golden
House; and, with philhellenism genuine or affected, built
in the Campus Martius a stadium for footraces in the Greek
fashion.</p>

<p>Since very little of Vespasian’s Forum of Peace remains
above ground, recourse for information about it must be had
in the first instance to literature. Pliny the Elder, who was
on Vespasian’s staff, described it as one of the most beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
squares in the world, embellished as it was with trophies
of war, including the famous seven-branched gold candlestick
from the temple in Jerusalem, carved in relief on the
Arch of Titus.</p>

<p>A fragment of the previously-mentioned Marble Plan of
Rome, the <i>Forma Urbis</i>, inscribed with the letters CIS
(<a href="#ip_9_1">Fig. 9.1</a>), is easily restored to something like [Forum Pa]
CIS, Forum of Peace. It shows a portico, on one side walled,
on the other colonnaded, the colonnade approached by
steps. An open space is incised with a series of three long
indented strips, apparently representing formal garden-plots.
The fragment also shows one right angle of a structure which
should be an altar.</p>

<p>Faced with the thousand pieces of the Marble Plan,
archaeologists play the fascinating game of making joins,
as in a jigsaw puzzle. In 1899 Lanciani announced the discovery
of a new fragment which joined with the piece of
the Marble Plan already mentioned. It filled out the rectangular
shape of the altar, added two more rows of garden-plots,
and supplied another side to the portico, at right
angles to the other. This side had two rows of columns, four
of which were represented as of larger dimensions than the
others, and as standing on plinths or square bases. These
two fragments made possible restoration, on paper, of a
considerable part of the Forum’s plan. Given the Roman
architectural principle of axial symmetry, Lanciani could
be sure that the altar belonged in the middle of one side
of the portico-surrounded space, towards the back. He could
restore two more column-bases; and, knowing that there
must have been three rows of garden-plots on either side
of the altar, and that the scale of the Marble Plan was 1:200,
he could arrive at the original length of one inner side of the
portico—about 325 feet. But there paper hypothesis had to
rest, awaiting excavation.</p>

The opportunity did not arise until 1934, in connection
with systematizing and beautifying with lawns the borders
of Mussolini’s grandiose new Via dell’ Impero, already mentioned
as having been cut through slums from the Coliseum
to the Piazza Venezia. The two projecting columns of the
<i>Forum Transitorium</i> (“Forum of Nerva”), southeast of the
Forum of Augustus, were cleared, under the direction of
A. M. Colini, of medieval and modern detritus down to their
plinths (Figs. <a href="#ip_9_2">9.2</a> and <a href="#ip_9_3">9.3</a>); the podium of the Temple of
Minerva, at the end of this Forum, uncovered; and the
<i>peperino</i> wall behind the projecting columns isolated. Close
in back of this wall, on the Forum of Peace side, Colini found
large columns in African marble, which, he inferred, marked
the missing northwest side of that Forum. Its general location
had been known since 1818, but only now was there a
<i>precise</i> point in modern Rome’s subsoil from which, with
the help of the Marble Plan, the true dimensions of Vespasian’s
portico could be measured. Also, another fragment
of the Marble Plan, not joining the two previously mentioned,
showed the very stretch of wall and the columns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
which Colini had been excavating, as well as the plan of
Minerva’s temple, whose podium he had uncovered.</p>

<p>Now that the plan of Vespasian’s Forum could be precisely
fitted into the plan of modern Rome, it became clear
that some fragments of large fluted white marble columns,
found in the southeastern part of this area as long ago as
1875, belonged to the part of the portico where the larger
columns shown on the Marble Plan would fall. Colini now
made another join on the Marble Plan, adding to Lanciani’s
fragment another piece, previously known but not connected,
which showed the Temple of Peace at the back of the portico.
It was an apsidal building, wider than it was deep, with
a pedestal for the cult statue indicated in the apse. If it
survived today it would come within a few feet of touching
the north corner of the Basilica of Maxentius. The south
side of the rectangular hall to the right of it coincides with
the actual wall of the church of Sts. Cosmas and Damian,
which was the findspot—in 1562—of the fragments of the
Marble Plan itself. This square hall was one of the libraries
of Vespasian’s Forum. Since the principle of axial symmetry
nearly always operates, justifying the hypothesis that what
appears on one side of the axis of a Roman plan will have a
twin on the other; and since the Romans usually built their
libraries in pairs (one Latin, one Greek), Colini quite
reasonably restored on paper another rectangular hall to
the left of the apsidal temple. A section of the polychrome
marble pavement, excavated by Colini east of the church
wall, was less than an inch thick, too thin to be exposed to
the weather. Colini inferred that it must have been part
of the flooring of the library in which the Marble Plan was
displayed.</p>

<p>An ingenious combination—“joins” recognized on the
Marble Plan, actual excavation, and inference—had now
made the Forum’s general outline clear, but Colini was not
yet done. Overlying the Forum’s outer (northeast) perimeter
wall, as he had plotted it, rose the medieval Torre dei<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
Conti, built by the brother of Pope Innocent III. Re-examining
beneath this tower the ancient remains, in squared
travertine, ordinary tufa, and <i>peperino</i>, Colini was able to
establish that they formed part of Vespasian’s Forum, a
great ornamental rectangular niche on its northeast side,
with two columns of African marble in front of it. Symmetry
would dictate another matching niche further to the southeast
in the same wall, and a pair on the opposite side to
correspond. Pink granite columns found in the excavations
belonged to the portico; marble gutters proved that it had
a pitched roof. Finally, in 1938, the plan was complete
enough for a model of the Forum to be made (<a href="#ip_9_4">Fig. 9.4</a>) for
Mussolini’s Mostra Augustea della Romanità, a great exhibition
of models and photographs of Roman architecture
and engineering, casts of inscriptions, and replicas of artifacts.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>But Vespasian’s Forum, famous as it was, and valuable
as its restored plan is to illustrate archaeological inference
at work, is overshadowed by his mightiest monument, which
has survived to become the very symbol of pagan Rome to
modern times: the Flavian Amphitheater or Coliseum. More
perhaps than any other classical monument, its stones are
steeped in blood and memories; in the blood of gladiators
and wild beasts, and perhaps of Christian martyrs, in memories
of medieval battles, Renaissance plundering of stone
(much of the travertine in St. Peter’s came from it), and
Victorian moonlight visits. Having resisted earthquakes,
fire, and demolition, it is now menaced by the vibrations
of modern traffic. Work on strengthening its walls against
this new threat has been going on since 1956.</p>

<p>For sheer mass the Coliseum deserves its name. It is a
third of a mile around, and the Italian engineer G. Cozzo
has calculated that 45,000 cubic meters of travertine went
into its outside wall, over twice as much into the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
structure. But the achievement here is not mere massiveness,
but precise engineering, careful calculations of stresses and
strains, avoidance of crowding at entrances and exits, perfect
visibility, ingenuity in the arrangements for getting the
wild beasts into the arena. (Perhaps this is the place to
recall that it was upon the Coliseum that Charles Follen
McKim based his design for the Harvard Stadium.) The
site chosen, the bed of the pool of Nero’s Golden House,
was good propaganda and good engineering. Propaganda-wise,
it made for good public relations to turn a detested
Emperor’s pleasure grounds into a place for public enjoyment.
(Neither Vespasian nor the Roman mob would have
thought of the slaughter of men and beasts as anything
but enjoyable; their attitude at best was that of Hemingway
to a bullfight.) From the engineering point of view, it
saved much costly excavation to pump out the pool and
use it for the substructure of the arena, and in the low,
soft ground, footings could go deep: eight feet of concrete
under the <i>cavea</i>. Besides, the huge mass of debris from the
demolished Golden House could be cannily reused in the
new fabric. The first step was to erect a skeleton of travertine
piers, a double row, built of squared blocks held together
not with mortar but with metal clamps. The holes
where these clamps were wrenched out, 300 metric tons
of them, in the metal-starved Middle Ages, are visible today
throughout the fabric. Differences in construction suggest
that the huge project was divided into four quadrants,
each assigned to a different contractor. Most of the work
is honest, so that, for example, one cannot get the proverbial
penknife blade into the joints between the blocks of the
piers, but in the northwest quadrant the work is shoddy.
This is precisely the section that has given the most trouble
under the strain of the traffic vibrations of modern times.</p>

<p>Inside the second concentric ellipse of piers begins a set
of radial walls which supported the seats. The slope of the
seats was perfectly calculated for perfect visibility. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
vaults of the lower levels were left open until the upper
level piers were finished. This made possible the use of
derricks to lift heavy blocks to the upper levels. The third-story
piers have one course of blocks projecting, to provide
a step to support the scaffolding required for building the
wall on the fourth level. This wall is built of smaller blocks
than those used on the lower levels, to facilitate lifting, and
it is full of second-hand materials; column drums, for example,
which may have come from the Golden House. The
outer face of the fourth-level wall is equipped with 240
consoles, projecting brackets jutting out from the wall to
support masts. Corresponding to each in the cornice above
is a hole for the mast. The mast, Cozzo argues persuasively,
was fitted with rope and pulley. The rope descended obliquely
and was fastened to another below which ran elliptically
at a convenient height above the podium of the arena.
Awnings, fixed to these ropes, could be rolled up or down
in strips as the sun’s position dictated. Awnings being made
of canvas, this duty was assigned to detachments of sailors—the
logical Roman administrative mind at work.</p>

<p>When the skeleton was finished, the space between the
piers in the radial walls was filled in, on the ground level
with tufa, on the second level with lighter materials, brick
and cement. Only then were the vaults completed. The
stairs were ingeniously planned to give access from the
ground direct to each level separately. This both emphasized
distinctions (VIPs in the lowest tier, women at the
top; compare the separate second-balcony stairs in modern
theaters) and facilitated entrance and exit. Each outside
entrance—there were originally eighty—bears a Roman numeral.
This corresponded to a number on the admission
ticket, and divided the 45,000 or 50,000 spectators into manageable
groups.</p>

<p>The arena proper was surrounded by a wall, high enough
to protect the spectators from the beasts (VIPs not being
regarded as expendable), but not so high as to block the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
view of the arena from the seats behind. Slots in the top
of this wall are the postholes for a dismountable fence which
supplied additional protection. Literary sources say it was
of gilt metal surmounted by elephants’ tusks. In front of
the fence ran a catwalk where archers were stationed to
shoot beasts which got out of hand.</p>

<p>The arena was originally floored with wooden planking,
removable for the mock naval battles which were staged
here in the early years of the amphitheater’s existence. Since
this had been the site of Nero’s artificial pool, flooding must
have been comparatively easy. But though slaves fought
and killed each other in these naval battles, they were less
sanguinary, and therefore less popular, than gladiatorial
contests or beast fights, and changing back and forth from
murder on water to murder on land was a nuisance, so
the naval battles were transferred elsewhere. The area below
the arena floor was then filled in with complicated substructures,
which finally revealed their secret to Cozzo in
1928.</p>

<p>The area under the catwalk in each quadrant contains
eight cell-like rooms (A in <a href="#ip_9_5">Fig. 9.5</a>), each big enough to
hold a man, and approached by a short corridor. Opening
out of each corridor, forward and to the left of a man
sitting in the cell, are three adjoining shafts, a small square
one (a), a large rectangular one (b), and another square
one (c) of medium size. How are these to be explained?
Cozzo reasoned that a beast was released from his cage
near the center of the substructure, into the corridor (1)
shown in <a href="#ip_9_6">Fig. 9.6</a>, with a portcullis (a) at the end of it.
The portcullis was raised, and the beast charged into the
transverse corridor (2). This was too narrow for him to
turn back; he was therefore forced to go forward into the
open elevator-cage (3). The attendant in the cell (A in
the previous figure) then released a counterweight, whose
rope ran in shaft (a) of <a href="#ip_9_5">Fig. 9.5</a>, while the weight itself
rose and fell in shaft (c); the elevator-shaft is (b). The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
elevator door then closed; the elevator rose, activated by
the counterweight, to position (4) in <a href="#ip_9_6">Fig. 9.6</a>. The beast
emerged into the narrow upper-level corridor (5–6), raced
up the ramp (7), and emerged, slavering for fresh meat,
through the trapdoor (8) into the arena.</p>

<p>This is not the only ingenious device in the Coliseum.
The substructure piers along the arena’s long axis are cut
obliquely. Why? Cozzo reasoned that on them rested, at
an angle below the horizontal, hinged sections of the area
flooring, on which stage sets could be placed, and the whole
section of flooring raised by counterweights to the arena
level, to provide appropriate backdrops or scenery for the
fights. Against such backdrops, scenes from myth or history
were acted out, the protagonists tortured to death before
delighted spectators. We hear of 11,000 beasts, and
5,000 pairs of gladiators, fighting to the death in one session
in the arena. In 1937, demolition of houses east of the
Coliseum revealed the ground plan of part of the gladiators’
barracks, with armory, infirmary, baths, and, for
training bouts, a miniature amphitheater, with seats for
rabid fans (<a href="#ip_9_7">Fig. 9.7</a>). To celebrate the millennium of Rome,
in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 248, elephants, elk, tigers, lions, leopards, hyenas,
hippopotamuses, a rhinoceros, zebras, giraffes, wild asses,
and wild horses (captured in Africa; see <a href="#ip_13_5">Fig. 13.5</a>) were
slaughtered in the Coliseum. This market of flesh did not
cease till the sixth Christian century.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Vespasian did not live to see the Coliseum completed. It
was dedicated, still unfinished, under Titus in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 80. The
chief surviving monument of Titus’ reign is his arch, commemorating
his conquest of the Jews in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 70, but, since
the inscription upon it refers to him as deified, it is clear
that the arch was not finished until after his death. Built
of valuable Pentelic marble, it would never have been preserved
if it had not been incorporated, in the Middle Ages,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
into a fortress of the powerful family of the Frangipani. The
last vestiges of the Frangipani tower were not removed
from the arch until 1821. It was then reinforced and its
missing portions restored in travertine. It is chiefly famous
for the relief on its inner jamb showing (<a href="#ip_9_8">Fig. 9.8</a>) Titus’
army carrying in triumph the spoils of Jerusalem, including
the table of the shewbread, the seven-branched candlestick,
and the silver trumpets. In the relief opposite, Titus stands
in a four-horse chariot, with the goddess Roma leading the
horses, and Victory crowning him with a laurel wreath. The
frieze under the cornice, not unrelated to the small inner
altar frieze of the Altar of Peace, portrays a procession of
priests, sacrificial animals, and troops carrying on their
shoulders small platforms bearing representations of cities
and places conquered by Roman arms, including a personification
of the River Jordan. The motif in the highest
part of the inner vault, showing Titus—who was a burly
man—carried off to heaven by an eagle, is as conventional
as the Ganymede in the vault of the underground basilica
at the Porta Maggiore. In the years since Augustus, Roman
official art had become conventional without ceasing to be
historical.</p>

<p>To the good Titus succeeded the wicked, psychopathic,
tyrannical Domitian, the greatest builder-Emperor since
Augustus, and one under whom the Empire took a long
stride on the road to absolutism. One evidence of Domitian’s
self-aggrandizement turned up unexpectedly in 1937, under
the Palazzo della Cancelleria in the Campus Martius, seat
of the papal Chancellery, and an enclave of Vatican City.
Curiously, the palace already had an intimate connection
with the Flavians: many of the stones in its fabric were
robbed in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth century from
the Coliseum. In connection with extensive repairs to the
building, deep excavations beneath it revealed the tomb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
of the consul Aulus Hirtius, a lieutenant of Julius Caesar’s,
who died in office, and in battle against Mark Antony, in
43 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Leaning face inwards against this tomb were five
slabs which proved to be part of a marble historical relief.
A sixth slab was found later nearby, still within papal jurisdiction;
a seventh, found under the sidewalk, technically
outside the Pope’s control, was first claimed by the Roman
civil authorities, but a trade was made for the slab of the
Altar of Peace then in Vatican hands, and all the slabs are
now reunited in a courtyard of the Vatican Museum.</p>

<div id="ip_9_9" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_077.jpg" width="600" height="474" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 9.9</span> (<i>top and bottom</i>) Vatican City. Cancelleria reliefs. (Musei Vatican)</div></div>

<p>The seven slabs combine into two sections of some sixteen
figures each, almost complete (<a href="#ip_9_9">Fig. 9.9</a>). The more fragmentary
of the two contains near its right end an instantly
identifiable figure, with the characteristic beaked profile of
Vespasian (<a href="#ip_9_10">Fig. 9.10</a>). He is greeting a young man, surely
one of his sons. Comparison with known portraits of Titus
and Domitian leads to the conclusion that it is the latter
who is represented here. The greeting is taking place in the
presence of lictors, Vestals (identified from their characteristic
headdress), <i>apparitores</i> or beadles (at either end),
a helmeted female figure (the goddess Roma or, according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
to others, the war-goddess Bellona, or the personification of
martial courage), and two male figures, one bearded (the
Genius of the Senate), and one beardless, with a cornucopia
(the Genius of the Roman People). The other section
is at once more complete, more difficult to interpret, and
more interesting. Several of the conventional figures recur:
the lictors, Roma, the two <i>Genii</i>. There are also six soldiers
(in the uniform and with the arms of the praetorian guard);
the wing of a Victory; a helmeted female wearing the <i>aegis</i>,
the characteristic breastplate of Minerva; the helmeted,
bearded male figure beside her must be another divinity,
Mars. The remaining figure, the first on the second slab from
the left (see <a href="#ip_9_11">Fig. 9.11</a>), is rendered in profile, and is clearly
intended as a portrait, but close examination, by Dr. F.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
Magi, Director of the Vatican Museums, shows that it was
reworked in antiquity.</p>

<p>Here archaeological ingenuity again goes to work. The
two sections of the total relief obviously (from the similar
technique and the recurrence of conventional figures in
both) belong together. The presence of Vespasian places
both sections in the Flavian age. Of the three Flavians, only
Domitian was sufficiently hated to have had <i>damnatio
memoriae</i> practiced upon him, to alter his portrait into
another’s. And the most conspicuous alteration of the head
consists in hacking off a fringe of curls on the forehead;
such a fringe was Domitian’s characteristic hair-style. It
remains to inquire whose the new profile is. In the context,
it must be an Emperor. The most likely candidate is Domitian’s
successor, Nerva, the first of the “five good Emperors.”
The new profile, with its irregular nose, lined forehead,
and sunken checks, suits the known iconography of
that tired old man. Left with the question why, then, the
portrait of Domitian on the other section of the relief was
left undamaged, Magi argued that the Senate, on second
thought, had considered the alteration into Nerva not
enough: the relief was dismantled altogether, and its slabs
carefully stacked against Hirtius’ tomb for the future use
of one of the stonecutters whose yards are known to have
been numerous in the area.</p>

<p>Two questions remain: the occasion for carving the relief
in the first place, and the building that housed it. The occasion
for greeting Vespasian must be the most memorable
one of his reign: his triumphant return from Jerusalem in
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 70. The occasion for greeting Domitian must be an
equally memorable one, almost certainly his setting out on
a campaign, or his return from a military victory (because
of the prominence of the winged figure and the Mars on
the relief). Domitian’s military successes were not many;
the likeliest is his campaign of <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 83 against a German
tribe, the Chatti. If carving the monument would take a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
year, as competent sculptors report, the earliest possible
date for the finished relief would be <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 84; on grounds of
style one authority, Miss Jocelyn M. Toynbee, would date
it eight or nine years later. To celebrate the same victory,
Domitian built the Temple of Fortuna Redux (Good Luck
and Safe Return), and this temple, Magi thinks, is a reasonable
place to suppose the reliefs to have been displayed.
In them the whole Roman state is portrayed as asking of
the founder of the Flavian dynasty and of his son the peace
and prosperity which the Julio-Claudians had failed to
give. Like the fresco of the Villa of the Mysteries at Pompeii,
the relief is not great art but a great document, a measure
of the distance Roman sculpture had travelled in the
scant century since the Altar of Peace. It is a courtier’s
exaltation of a monarch; a solemn, highly rhetorical affirmation
of Imperial sovereignty and pride in Rome’s dominion.
And perhaps there is a moral in it, too: it summarizes the
history of the dynasty, from the triumphant reception of
the first Flavian to the explosion of hate which damned
the memory, by altering the face, of the last. And these
slabs, the expression of a despot’s pride, end leaning against
the simple tomb of a lieutenant of Julius Caesar who died
fighting, he would have said, to save for his fatherland its
free institutions.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>In <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 86 Domitian set about continuing the work begun
by Vespasian on the narrow Forum between the Forum of
Peace and that of Augustus, which we have had occasion
to mention earlier. (The final dedication was not to occur
until Nerva’s reign.) In effect this Forum was an ingenious
device to monumentalize the street which led from the old
Republican Forum to the unsavory Subura district and
workers’ quarter to the north. Caesar’s Forum was Venus’
precinct; Augustus’ belonged to Mars. A convention had
been established, a canonical way of doing things: hence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
Vespasian dedicated his larger Forum to Peace, the <i>Forum
Transitorium</i> to Minerva. Domitian, his devotion to Minerva
already established by his having given her prominence
on the Cancelleria relief, now remodelled Vespasian’s temple
to her, raising it on a high podium. The podium alone
remains, with its relieving arch marking where the Cloaca
Maxima or great sewer passed below. But the original
monumentalizing of the street by Vespasian had involved
building a colonnade, of a type common in the frescoes of
the Pompeian Third and Fourth Styles. Along its architrave,
which was richly decorated on its under side, ran a continuous
frieze whose technique resembles that of the Cancelleria
relief on a small scale, for the art of the Flavian
reigns is recognizably related. The dentils in the cornice
show between them the characteristic “spectacles-signature”
of the architect Rabirius, who may have worked for Vespasian
as well as for Domitian.</p>

<p>The surviving section of the frieze portrays Minerva
among the nine Muses, and the punishment of Arachne,
who for presuming to rival Minerva’s skill at weaving was
turned into a spider. The sculptor took the occasion to
carve artisans (the figure of a fuller survives) and household
scenes, of spinning, weaving, and dyeing, all under
Minerva’s special patronage. One sees the wool basket, the
upright loom, the scales for weighing the day’s stint, the
proud display of a finished roll of cloth. In the attic above
the surviving section of the frieze stands the goddess in relief,
wearing the characteristic cloak of a Roman general!</p>

<p>Recent excavation has added little to earlier knowledge
of this Forum, but it is of absorbing interest for what it adds
to our portrait of the Flavians. Domitian takes over his
father’s plan, and pushingly insinuates himself, as it were,
between his father and the Empire’s founder, both of whom
he envied and tried to emulate. But it was beyond even his
effrontery to associate himself with the Minerva who was
patroness of artisans; nothing could be more incongruous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
than his connecting his elegant dilettantism with the homely
arts of the household. The frieze is probably a part of Vespasian’s
plan: its theme suits his plain personality, and the
references to handicrafts suit its location on a street leading
to a worker’s quarter. The support of the workers (and
of their wives, whose influence was all the more important
to win because it was indirect) was worth having, and
meanwhile Minerva’s connection with the Muses (the creative
arts and literature) could be turned by Domitian to
his purpose: he desired to be known as a patron of the
arts.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The showiest surviving result of Domitian’s patronage
of the art of architecture is his palace on the Palatine,
planned by the famous Rabirius, and finished perhaps in
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 92. Here is a return, after the comparative austerity
of his father’s and brother’s reigns, to the baroque extravagance
of Nero. Since no final publication of this important
complex has ever appeared, the best archaeology can do
is to comment on the palace as reflecting Domitian’s personality,
as indebted to earlier, and seminal of later Roman
architecture. Its throne room (21B on the plan, <a href="#ip_9_12">Fig. 9.12</a>),
with its colossal niches for statues, was built for an Emperor
with delusions of divinity. The dining room (H) had a dais
to elevate the god-Emperor above his guests, but the peristyle
(D), originally faced with marbles polished like mirrors
(to reflect possible assassins), was planned by a terrified
mortal who feared stabs in the back. (Blocks from the
peristyle cornice show, as in the <i>Forum Transitorium</i>, Rabirius’
“spectacles-signature.”) The restless inward and outward
curves of the rooms at 21E in the west block (the public
part) of the palace, and at 23C and D in the eastern private
quarters, were made possible by the flexibility of poured
concrete, which, as we saw in Chapter V, makes it possible
to enclose space in any shape (see reconstruction, <a href="#ip_9_13">Fig. 9.13</a>).<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245<br /><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
This fluidity appealed to Hadrian, the most gifted amateur
architect among the Emperors, and he imitated it, as we
shall see, in his Villa near Tivoli.</p>

<p>The <i>impluvium</i> (pool for rain-water) in the peristyle
(23B) of the private quarters contained a fountain, and
is curiously treated with cut-out segments of circles, with
cuttings in its top face for setting statues. This combination
of plays of water and works of art is in the taste of the Sperlonga
villa of Tiberius: ancient sources find a parallel between
that monarch’s suspicious, tyrannical nature and
Domitian’s. The small temple in the upper peristyle (24E),
connected with the “mainland” by a curious seven-arched
bridge, was built, to judge by its materials and technique,
two centuries later than Domitian. But his is the “stadium”
(26). Its portico makes it unlikely that it was ever a track
for running races in the Greek style; he was to build such
a stadium full-scale in the Campus Martius in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 93. The
Palatine stadium, in spite of its apsidal Imperial spectator’s
box (the model for Bramante’s Vatican Belvedere), was
probably a garden for shady strolling. Perhaps Hadrian had
this plan in mind when he built the so-called “Painted
Porch” or “Poecile” of his villa, to which we shall return.
It is hard to realize that all this splendor lies only 100 yards
from the site of “Romulus’” straw hut. The difference measures
the distance Roman culture had travelled in 800 years.</p>

<p>Nowadays, one can sit under the umbrella pines of a
summer evening and hear symphony concerts played in
Domitian’s stadium-garden. On such occasions it may seem
less of a pity that the Palatine is incompletely excavated.
Here, on this hill of dreams, as Miss Scherer calls it, one
can imagine Domitian’s palace rich with many-colored
marbles, bright with paintings and gold. One can wander
in the dappled light among oleander and orange-trees,
golden broom and scarlet poppies, and admire how the mellow
brick glows rose-colored in the afternoon sunlight. One
can appreciate the mood of the Romantics for whom, a century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
and a half ago, all Rome had this dream-like quality.
One can argue that their attitude may not have been scientific,
but it produced the classical revival in architecture.
Here is the old dilemma, but its horns are properly labelled
not art and science, but sentiment and intelligence. If we
want truly to understand ancient Rome, the choice is clear.
Sentiment is not a Roman quality; intelligence is. The atmosphere
of Domitian’s reign was not dream but nightmare.
The natural beauty of the Palatine is attractive but
adventitious; the essence of the place is of another kind,
starker, grander, more disciplined, than a nineteenth-century
water color, and behind it looms always the shadow
of violence.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Not violence but intelligence, and the affectation of Hellenism,
lies behind Domitian’s stadium (for Greek games)
and odeum, or music hall (for literary and musical competitions)
in the Campus Martius. The shape of the stadium
has been preserved almost intact in the loveliest of Rome’s
squares, the Piazza Navona (<a href="#ip_9_14">Fig. 9.14</a>). In 1936 the driving
of a great new street, the Corso del Rinascimento, north
and south through the Campus Martius, as a part of Mussolini’s
ambitious new city plan, gave an opportunity for
definitive examination of the stadium’s remains, preserved
in the cellars of shops and the crypts of churches. This Colini
undertook, and emerged from his mole-like labors with a
plan (<a href="#ip_9_15">Fig. 9.15</a>) and a model (<a href="#ip_9_16">Fig. 9.16</a>) of the stadium,
a prime example of what archaeology can do with bits and
pieces. Nowadays remains of the hemicycle are visible
under an insurance building outside the north end of the
<i>piazza</i>, and one travertine pier is to be seen under the arcade
of the Corsia Agonale, in the middle of the stadium’s east
side. Beneath this area are traces of the footings, of cement
poured in caissons, thicker and stronger the farther east
they go, to support the increasing weight of the rising tiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
of seats above. Brick stamps found here date the building
to <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 93 or a little after, with evidence of major repairs
under Hadrian—another Greek lover—and Caracalla—another
violent despot.</p>

<p>Colini found that Domitian’s architect, to compensate for
providing here only one <i>ambulacrum</i> or vaulted corridor
for sauntering, where the Coliseum had two, widened his
corridor at regular intervals between the stairs to provide
halls where spectators—the stadium had seats for 30,000—might
congregate between footraces. The stadium was built
in a repeated sequence: stair, entrance, hall, entrance, stair,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
which gives classical orderliness and efficiency to the plan
(perhaps Rabirius’). In the center of the west side was the
Imperial box: the crypt of the church of Sant’ Agnese marks
its substructure. Here, according to legend, the good saint
suffered martyrdom, condemned by the Emperor Diocletian
to the brothels that flourished in the stadium arcades. The
whole building profited by the experience of the builders
of the Coliseum, as they in turn had profited from the experience
of the builders of the Theater of Marcellus. Thus
its exterior was adorned with engaged columns, Doric on the
first level, Corinthian on the second. But the total effect
was deliberately different, graceful where the Coliseum was
massive, dedicated to Greek footraces instead of Roman
blood-sports. The only thing of its kind outside the Greek
world, the stadium was a deliberate flouting of Roman tradition.
This was in Domitian’s manner. The Roman people
rejected it, in theirs. To them, Greek footraces represented
foreign degeneracy, nudism, and immorality. No sooner
was the tyrant murdered (in a courtier’s plot sparked by
his wife) than they went back to their simple pleasures of
watching the murder of gladiators and wild beasts. Domitian’s
odeum, traces of which were found south of the stadium
in 1936–37, did not suffer the same fate, for it could
be used for pantomime (see <a href="#ip_13_1">Fig. 13.1</a>) and other degraded
forms of dramatic art.</p>

<p>Here then, is a part, a small part, of what archaeology
can tell us of the prodigious Flavian activity in architecture
and in art. It will be noticed that, not for the first or the
last time in Roman history, the greatest tyrant is also the
greatest builder. (He is also Rome’s last great Emperor who
did not come from the provinces.) Absolutism was the price
Rome paid for its grandeur. But, in the century after Domitian’s
murder, absolutism marked time. Nerva’s successor,
the Spaniard Trajan, is the second of the “five good Emperors,”
under whom the metropolis and its port prospered,
and the provinces lived content.</p>

<span class="subhead">Trajan: Port, Forum, Market, Column</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Archaeologically speaking, the most important sites in Italy
to illustrate Roman events and the Roman way of life in
the happy reign (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 98–117) of Trajan—called <i>Optimus
Princeps</i>, “best of princes”—are the port of Ostia, which in
his time reached its apogee, and his Forum, the last and
grandest of the Imperial Fora.</p>

<p>Our present knowledge of Ostia, extending far beyond
the early <i>castrum</i> discussed in Chapter IV, is due in large
part to the devoted skill of Guido Calza. Under some pressure
from Mussolini, who wanted the dig finished for an
exposition scheduled for 1942 (but never inaugurated), he
supervised the removal in four years of over 600,000 cubic
yards of earth, recovering some seventy of the 170 acres
enclosed within Ostia’s Sullan wall. What he uncovered he
rejuvenated but did not falsify: his method was much the
same as Spinazzola’s in Pompeii. This was his principle:
“Better to brace than repair, better repair than restore, better
restore than embellish; never add or subtract.” His aim
was not to suppress inconvenient ugliness, but to remove
impediments to study and understanding. He restored mosaics,
making a clear distinction between the old <i>tesserae</i>
and the new; re-erected columns, put balconies back in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
place, rebuilt wooden ceilings to protect houses from the
weather. He detached wall-paintings, reinforced them with
cement and wire mesh, and replaced them, covered with
glass, and protected against mold by the insertion of lead
plates into the wall below the painting, to retard the spread,
by capillary action, of dampness. He sealed the tops of
walls, freed flights of stairs from rubble, opened out windows
which had been bricked up in late antiquity. He
planted trees, and set a privet hedge to mark the line of
the city wall. He restored the ancient drainage-system. The
result of all this careful work was to present to the modern
world a picture of Roman life under the Empire only a
shade less vivid than Pompeii. And the picture is not of a
provincial town, but of the very vestibule of Rome itself,
in fact a Rome in miniature, for Ostia gives an excellent
notion of what life in the metropolis was like at the height
of the Empire. And thanks to the careful work on the brick
stamps by Professor Herbert Bloch of Harvard, most of the
buildings excavated can be dated with a very fair degree of
precision, so that Ostia’s development can be accurately
traced from end to end.</p>

<p>We know from an inscription that Trajan’s artificial harbor,
whose completion marked the beginning of Ostia’s
peak of prosperity, was built in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 104. Ostia proper was
at the very mouth of the Tiber, but silting, which today
has put the beach of modern Ostia (Ostia Lido) three miles
beyond the seawall of the ancient town, early made the
city docks impracticable for any but the smallest vessels,
so that Trajan built his harbor beside (indeed over the
necropolis of) Claudius’, two-and-a-half miles northwest of
the town. The traffic in grain and luxury goods to feed
and pander to the more or less refined tastes of the largest
and richest city in the world made Ostia vastly prosperous.
The evidence is building activity, dated by brick stamps,
impressed on building tiles, and bearing the names of consuls,
tile manufacturers, or both. There was a slight time-<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>lag,
while prosperity built up. Only twelve per cent of the
datable buildings in Ostia belong to Trajan’s reign; forty-three
per cent were built or restored under Hadrian. Then
activity tapers off again: seventeen per cent of the buildings
are of Antonine date (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 138–192), while only twelve
per cent belong to the age of the Severi (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 193–235).
Thereafter Ostia, whose fortunes rose with Rome’s, declines
with her also.</p>

<p>The most illuminating way to describe what archaeology
has to tell us about Ostia is to follow the plan used
for Pompeii, treating in order the town and its population,
municipal life and public amenities, housing arrangements,
trade and industry, and the evidence for Ostia’s religious
life. Art in Ostia hardly deserves separate treatment: it is,
naturally, less well-preserved than at Pompeii, and what
there is seldom rises above the level of pure documentation.</p>

<p>The plan of Ostia (Figs. <a href="#ip_10_1">10.1</a> and <a href="#ip_10_2">10.2</a>) is regular but
not regimented. It has unity in variety; it combines utility,
a monumental quality, and the scenic. Its backbone is the
major east-west street, the <i>decumanus</i>, nearly a mile long,
and once colonnaded, which runs from the Porta Romana
straight to the Forum. Beyond the line of the west <i>castrum</i>
wall it forks sharply to the left, ending at the Porta Marina,
which once fronted directly on the sea. The main north-south
street, the <i>cardo</i>, began at the Porta Laurentina on
the south—Ostia’s triplicity of gates is an Etruscan heritage—and
ran, shaded and porticoed, northwestward to the dazzling
whiteness of the colonnaded, marble-enriched Forum.
Then it split in two on either side of Hadrian’s Capitolium
and passed north between balconied houses to the river.
Sixteen per cent of Ostia’s total area, exactly the same proportion
as a modern city such as Madison, Wisconsin, was
devoted to streets. Twelve per cent of Ostia was taken up
by baths, fifteen per cent by warehouses (for Ostia was
first and foremost a commercial town), and fifty-seven per
cent by houses, most of which are middle-class apartment
blocks. Knowing the total housing area available, and calculating
twenty-six square meters of space for each person,
Calza reckoned the maximum population at 35,000 to
40,000.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
The evidence for Ostia’s municipal life comes mostly
from inscriptions, over 6000 of them, many unpublished.
They show that Ostia, like most Italian towns, imitated
Rome: since Rome had a pair of chief municipal officers,
the consuls, Ostia had a pair also, the <i>duoviri</i>. There was
a town council of 110 members, which met in a marble-floored
council house facing the Forum. Legal activity went
on across the street in the basilica, also paved with marble,
and with a pleasant portico facing the Forum. It had a
charming frieze of Cupids carrying garlands. Both buildings
are of Trajanic date; the prevalence of marble in them
can be explained by the ease with which the stone could
be brought by ships in ballast. There was a municipal plutocracy,
whose names occur and recur on honorific decrees
(praising them for benefactions), and on tombs near the
Porta Romana and Porta Marina. The names are those of
businessmen and freedmen, not of the old Roman aristocratic
families. And as the years wear on men seldom hold
office more than once, for it grew to be an expensive honor.
If taxes assessed by the Imperial treasury were not collected
in full, town officers had to make up the deficit out of their
own pockets.</p>

<p>Public amenities included a theater, baths, and a fire
department. The theater, built in Augustus’ reign (about
12 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), and often restored and enlarged, seats 2700, and
is used nowadays for outdoor performances of Greek and
Roman plays. Behind it is a portico where theater patrons
might saunter, with a temple in its midst built by Domitian.
In a combination of business with pleasure typical of Ostia,
seventy offices face the four sides of the portico. These
offices, to be discussed in more detail below, were maintained
by local branches of firms from all over the Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
Ostia was well equipped with public baths. The three
most interesting belong to the middle years of the second
century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> The Baths of Neptune, near the theater (<i>Regio</i>
II, <i>Insula</i> iv), have a large entrance hall paved with a
spirited mosaic showing Neptune driving four sea-horses,
surrounded by Tritons, Nereids, dolphins ridden by Cupids,
fabulous sea monsters of every kind, and two young men
swimming. The Baths of the Seven Sages (<i>Reg.</i> III,x) are
named from a painting in their dressing room which depicts
the seven wise men of Greece, each labelled with an off-color
couplet describing in some detail the intimate connection
between constipation and the intellectual life. The
most interesting of all are the Forum Baths (<i>Reg.</i> I,xii). A
recent study by an American heating engineer, E. D.
Thatcher, underlines how well the Romans understood the
principles of radiant heating (of floors, walls, bathing pools,
and even vaults), and orientation of bathing rooms to catch
the maximum amount of sunlight, and to provide a windbreak,
so that, although the large windows were not glazed,
the rooms were usable on most days of the year, even in
winter, with additional provision, proved by put-holes, of
a rigging of canvas for the coldest days. If the windows
had been glazed, bathers could not have acquired a tan,
whose therapeutic and fashionable implications were the
same for an Ostian as for us. Thatcher calculates that an
unglazed room in the Forum Baths was usable ninety-eight
per cent of the time: hence glazing was not worth while.
The Romans knew, as the Forum Baths show, that the flow
of heat is always from a hotter body to a colder one, and
that air temperature alone is no criterion of comfort. In
fact one may be comfortable in a much lower air temperature
than that found in most American houses and public
buildings, provided one does not lose more heat than one
is generating at the time. The floor and wall surfaces of
the Forum Baths radiated enough warmth to keep bathers
comfortable in relatively cool air with unglazed windows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
The courtyard of the baths was paved with white mosaic to
reflect light and heat. A room which commanded a maximum
of sunlight has radiant heat in the floor only, not in
the walls. The various rooms of the baths were heated to
different temperatures; Romans achieved with differently
heated areas what we achieve with thermostats. The whole
complex of the Forum Baths, Thatcher concludes, shows a
sophistication in the use of radiant heating well beyond
what modern engineers have achieved.</p>

<p>Though brick construction made Ostia more nearly fireproof
than a modern city of frame dwellings, the grain for
the dole stored in the city’s numerous warehouses was too
valuable a commodity to risk, so a cohort of firemen detached
from the main corps in Rome was kept at the ready
in barracks behind the Baths of Neptune (<i>Reg.</i> II,v). The
barracks, built under Hadrian, surround an arcaded courtyard
with rooms opening off. A latrine with a shrine in it
thriftily combines cleanliness with godliness. At the end
of the courtyard opposite the entrance is a platform which
still bears the bases of statues of Emperors worshiped by
the firemen as a part of the Imperial cult.</p>

<p>As at Pompeii, so at Ostia, the houses are the most interesting
part of the city, not least because Ostian houses
differ completely in plan from Pompeian ones. The great
majority are apartment houses, tall, many-windowed brick
blocks, with or without shops on the ground floor. They
were designed to be rented out in flats, with separate access
to the upper stories from the street. Some have balconies,
opening both on the street and on garden courtyards where
many families shared the pergolas, fountains, trees, shrubs,
pools, and statue-studded lawns, as they shared also the
large common latrines. The Casa dei Dipinti (<i>Reg.</i> III,iv;
see <a href="#ip_10_3">Fig. 10.3</a>) is such a block, built in Hadrian’s reign. The
ground-floor flats have mosaic floors and paintings of mythological
scenes, figures of poets and dancers, landscapes,
and fantastic motifs. At the end of the garden is yet another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
of Ostia’s combinations of the useful with the ornamental:
a number of large <i>dolia</i>, terracotta jars sunk in the ground
for storing oil or grain. Despite the panegyrics of the excavators,
there is a certain deadly sameness about these
flats where the lower middle class lived their lives of quiet
desperation, as they do in the unfashionable quarters of
Rome today.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 10.3</span> Ostia, Casa dei Dipinti, Gismondi’s reconstruction. (Alinari)</div></div>

<p>The occupants of Ostia’s flats were largely tradesmen or
minor civil servants. Their livelihood came from Ostia’s
two artificial harbors (<a href="#ip_10_4">Fig. 10.4</a>). The earlier, begun under
Claudius in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 42, is now the site of a military airport,
whose engineers have preserved the traces (<a href="#ip_10_5">Fig. 10.5</a>) of
the two curving moles which enclosed a basin over 850,000
square yards in area. Ancient sources say there was an
artificial island between the arms of the moles, with a lighthouse
on it which became the symbol of Ostia: it is often
figured in mosaics. A canal, now the Fiumicino branch of
the Tiber, connected the harbor with the main stream.</p>

<p>Grandiose as it was, the harbor was ill-protected from
prevailing winds: a storm in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 62 wrecked 200 ships anchored
or berthed in it. Trajan therefore built a smaller
but more efficient basin (<a href="#ip_10_6">Fig. 10.6</a>), hexagonal in shape and
with numbered berths where ships might tie up to discharge
their cargoes directly into warehouses on all six
sides. A complicated entrance with a right-angled turn protected
it completely from the hazards which had plagued
Claudius’ harbor; it also was connected with the Claudian
canal. Nowadays it forms a pool on the Torlonia estate, and
access to it is almost invariably refused.</p>

<p>The ships that unloaded at the quays of Claudius’ or
Trajan’s harbor came from all over the Mediterranean. Their
agents had their in-town offices in the portico behind the
Augustan theater, called by the Italians the <i>Piazzale delle
Corporazioni</i>. Each office had an emblem in mosaic before
its door, indicating the commodity it imported or the service
it rendered. These mosaics, plus inscriptions, document the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
greatest variety of goods and services, giving a clear idea
how busy the port of Rome was in the high Empire. The
commodities included furs, wood, grain, beans, melons, oil,
fish, wine, drugs, mirrors, flowers, ivory, gold, and silk.
Among the service personnel were the caulkers, cordwainers,
grain-measurers, maintenance-men for the docks,
warehouses, and embankments, shipwrights, bargemen, carpenters,
masons, muleteers, carters, stevedores, and divers
for sunken cargoes. The home offices, often recorded in
the mosaics, include ports famous or forgotten in North
Africa, Sardinia, Gaul, and Spain. Ostia proper, as well as
the ports, was full of warehouses where these multifarious
goods were stored. Their plan, multistoried around a courtyard,
was to influence the luxurious <i>palazzi</i> of the Renaissance.
(When McKim, Mead, and White built the Boston
Public Library, for example, their ultimate model was an
Ostia warehouse.) The headquarters of the various guilds
grew, in the second and third centuries, very luxurious, with
airy courtyards and temples in imported marble, testifying
to the power and prosperity of these ancient labor unions.
Perhaps, then as now, the labor leaders were more prosperous
than the rank and file, for in Ostia as in Pompeii,
the multitude of small shops, of fishmongers, fullers, and
millers, and the omnipresent <i>thermopolia</i> or bars, are humble
enough, often with dark, cramped living quarters behind
or on a mezzanine.</p>

<p>Ostia’s world-wide trade made her a melting-pot, and
her temples reinforce the point. Besides the temples of the
Imperial cults and the official religion, like the Temple
of Rome and Augustus, Hadrian’s lofty Capitolium, and
the half-scale Pantheon, all in the Forum, there is, near
the Porta Laurentina (<i>Reg.</i> IV,i) the temple of the Phrygian
Great Mother, where her emasculated priests once clashed
their cymbals. Near the Porta Marina (<i>Reg.</i> III,xvii) is the
temple of the Egyptian Serapis, conveniently located for
sailors just in from the Levant. Everywhere there were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
shrines of the Persian Mithras: eighteen of them have
been found, ranging in date from <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 160 to 250. They
always occupy a retired, obscure corner of a pre-existent
building; they are apparently intended to symbolize the
cave where Mithras was born to his life of struggle with
the powers of darkness for the immortal souls of men. They
are usually oblong with shallow benches along the sides,
with an altar or cult statue at the end. The favorite cult
statute is of Mithras slaying the bull; being washed in the
blood of a freshly slaughtered bull brought redemption into
immortality to Mithras’ votaries. One Ostian Mithraeum,
that of Felicissimus (<i>Reg.</i> V,ix; see <a href="#ip_10_7">Fig. 10.7</a>) has a mosaic
pavement representing the seven stages of initiation, somewhat
like the degrees of freemasonry. Each has its appropriate
symbol: the Crow, the Bridegroom, the Soldier, the
Lion, the Persian (with a scimitar), the Sun-runner, and
the Father, or Worshipful Master. The cult was for men
only: it appealed to merchants, freedmen and soldiers.</p>

<p>In the fourth century in Ostia some of these were won
away by another Oriental religion, Christianity. A house
(<i>Reg.</i> IV, iii) with a mosaic of the communion chalice, set
with the Christian symbol of the fish (the initial letters of
the word for “fish” in Greek stand for “Jesus Christ, Son of
God, Saviour”) may have been the residence of the bishop.
A remodeled bath (<i>Reg.</i> III,i) made over into a humble
Christian basilica, may be the place where Augustine worshiped
in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 387, as recorded in his <i>Confessions</i>. Part of
the tombstone of his mother Monica, who died in Ostia,
was found a few years ago in the neighboring modern village
of Ostia Antica. The altar of the Mithraeum next to
the basilica was found smashed by Christian wrath into
a thousand pieces.</p>

<p>When Saint Augustine worshiped in Ostia, the city was
already in full decline. The Emperor Constantine had revoked
its municipal status, and assigned it to the village
called Portus which had grown up around Trajan’s harbor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
The cemetery of Portus, on Isola Sacra, the island between
the Fiumicino and the principal mouth of the Tiber, contains
a few Christian burials. It is chiefly noteworthy for the class
distinctions it reveals between the wealthy in their fine
vaulted brick tombs, embellished with paintings and mosaics
(very like those found in the cemetery under St.
Peter’s), and the poor, whose ashes rest in the miserable
amphorae stuck in the low-lying ground. By the end of the
fourth century, burials in this cemetery ceased, mute and
pathetic evidence of the decline of Portus itself. Ostia proper
agonized on to its end. The flat slabs of inscriptions are
re-used as shop-counters, or to mend pavements. Architectural
marbles are sawed up into latrine-seats. Statues are
reduced to lime or used, whole or decapitated, to repair
breaches in the city wall. The water-pipes break and are not
repaired, fallen house-walls are left lying, rubble piles up
forty feet deep. Sacked by the barbarian, decimated by
malaria, Ostia by the fifth century was desolate, and the
road to Rome overgrown with trees. Only a Christian chapel
by the theater, marking the spot where a Christian was
martyred, was left to mark the spot.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>Besides embellishing the Forum at Ostia with its basilica
and council-house, Trajan, through his architect, the Syrian
Apollodorus of Damascus, adorned Rome with the last,
largest, and finest of the Imperial Fora (see Figs. <a href="#ip_5_13">5.13</a> and
<a href="#ip_9_4">9.4</a>). We know from an inscribed record, the <i>Fasti Ostienses</i>,
found in re-use to repair a floor in an ancient private house
in Ostia, that its dedication day was May 18, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 113. Its
general plan has been known since the French excavations
of 1812. Its inspiration is the porticoes of Caesar’s Forum
and the apses and the Hall of Fame of Augustus’. In conception
it is axially symmetric and tripartite: the Forum
proper, the basilica, and the famous Column behind, flanked
by a pair of libraries. Hadrian added the Temple of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Deified Trajan, now destroyed, which closed the vista to
the west.</p>

<p>The Forum proper lay at right angles to the Forum of
Augustus, its façade bowed slightly out, like the <i>Forum
Transitorium</i>. Its entrance was through a triumphal arch,
added in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 117, after Trajan’s death. In the middle of the
great porticoed square, over 620 feet wide, with apses on
either side, was placed a great equestrian statue of Trajan;
the Romans used to say that never did a horse have such
a stable.</p>

<p>At the back of the open square which forms the Forum
proper lay the basilica, its two short sides curved, like the
sides of the Forum, into apses. The basilica presents its long
side to the Forum as Italian basilicas regularly did, but was
much grander than the basilicas of Alba, Cosa, or even the
Basilica Julia in the old Forum. The basilica had two double
rows of columns, in gray granite and polychrome marble:
the yellow <i>giallo antico</i>, from Numidia; the striated green
<i>cipollino</i>, “onion-stone”; the purple-streaked <i>pavonazzetto</i>,
“peacock-stone”—Italian masons have over 500 different
names for marble. The architraves were marble, crystalline
white from Mt. Pentelicus in Attica. The walls were veneered
with marble, from Carrara. The roof was plated with gilt
bronze. It was this magnificence which the Christians
sought to imitate in their great early basilica churches in
Rome, where the high altar stood in the place of the judges’
tribunal: Old St. Peter’s, Santa Sabina, St. John Lateran, St.-Paul’s-Without-the-Walls,
San Lorenzo. Trajan’s goodness as
<i>optimus princeps</i> was legendary to early Christians; Trajan’s
basilica supplied a noble model for early Christian churches;
Pope Sixtus V did Trajan a grave injustice when he replaced
his statue at the top of the Column with one of St. Peter.</p>

<p>Behind the basilica a pair of small libraries, one Greek
and one Latin, faced the tiny square in the midst of which
rose Trajan’s 100-foot column. Its shaft, of Parian marble,
was wound about with 155 scenes on the twenty-three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
spirals of the great scroll, whose bands grow wider the
higher they go, so that they were “readable” to a great
height, especially from the library balconies. Unrolled, the
scroll would be 650 feet long. It described in 2500 figures
the events of Trajan’s two campaigns, of <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 101–102 and
105–106, against the Dacians, ancestors of the modern
Rumanians. It is because of Trajan’s conquests, imposing
Roman culture, that Rumanians speak a Romance language,
derived from Latin, today.</p>

<p>To what that great scroll has to tell us about the Roman
attitude—and the sculptor’s—to the art of war we shall return.
For the moment another matter is of interest: the
inscription on the column-base. It states that the column
marks the height of earth that was removed to make room
for it. For centuries it was inferred that Trajan’s engineers
had cut away a whole saddle connecting the Esquiline with
the Capitoline Hill. But in 1907 Boni published the results
of excavations around the base of the column, which revealed
a street, a wall, and houses, dated by their pottery—Arretine
and earlier—to the late Republic. Hence there
probably never was a saddle of hill here. What then does the
inscription mean? Boni fixed his eye on the terraced slope
of the Quirinal to the north of the Forum, and concluded—rightly,
as later excavation proved—that what Trajan was
referring to was the cutting down and terracing of this
slope for some purpose to be connected with the Forum.
What that purpose was did not transpire until 1928, when
Corrado Ricci cleared the area of medieval and later accretions
and discovered the six levels of Trajan’s Market
(<a href="#ip_10_8">Fig. 10.8</a>).</p>

<p>The terrace treatment clearly goes back for inspiration
to the Sanctuary of Fortune at Praeneste. Brick stamps
show that the Market was built before the Forum: the shape
in which the hill was dug out left space for the Forum apse
when it came to be built. Form follows function: the hemicycle
shows the classical virtues of symmetry, regularity,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
and creative exploitation of tradition, but the shape is
practical, too: it allows space for nearly twice as many
rooms as would have been possible with a rectilinear front.
The shop fronts are good-looking as well as utilitarian. The
ground floor rooms are handsomely framed in travertine;
the second level windows are arched, and framed with
pilasters, much as at Praeneste, with pediments alternately
curved and triangular, the triangular pediments are sometimes
deliberately broken, never coming to an apex, a trick
of style imitated with success by eighteenth century English
furniture designers like Chippendale. But this is an old
thing in a new way, for here the material is not stone but
brick, the beautifully-proportioned rose-red Roman kind,
used unashamedly without veneer of stucco or marble, like
the rose-red arcades of Renaissance Bologna.</p>

<div id="ip_10_8" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_084.jpg" width="600" height="521" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 10.8</span> Rome, Trajan’s Market. (Fototeca)</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Some of the rooms have drains in the floor for carrying
of spilled liquid; the inference is that these were wine or
oil shops; those without such provision would be for dry
commodities like grain. There are 150 of these shops altogether,
all more or less identical. The whole complex has
the air not of private enterprise but of a government project,
and it seems a reasonable guess that here we have the headquarters
of the <i>annona</i>, the government dole of wine, oil,
and grain, the cargoes of the ships that docked in Trajan’s
port of Ostia.</p>

<p>Access to the second level is by stairs at either end of the
hemicycle, not in the middle. The split approach is borrowed
from the exedra of Terrace VII at Praeneste. (It was brick
stamps in these stairs that enabled Bloch to date this complex
in the first decade of the second century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>). The
second-floor shops open onto a semicircular vaulted corridor
with windows opening on the Forum. On the third level
variety within unity, plus ease of access for wagons, is
achieved by a semicircular street on which the third level
shops face. A straight stretch of paving running north and
south, called the Via Biberatica—“Pepper or Spice Street”—and
concealed by the façade, contains shops with balconies,
as at Ostia. Stairs ascend from this level to a great rectangular
cross-vaulted basilical hall, with shops opening off it
at two levels. Some archaeologists think this was the place
where the dole was distributed; others see in it ancient
Rome’s wholesale grain, oil, and wine market, like the Pit
in Chicago where bidding fixes the day’s commodity prices.
The interconnecting suites of rooms on the fifth and sixth
levels are clearly not shops, but offices for administrative
personnel. One large centrally-located room, with a view
over the whole complex, would be a good place for the office
of the superintendent of the entire affair, the <i>praefectus
annonae</i>.</p>

<p>Trajan’s Market did not let his people forget his generosity.
Trajan’s Column did not let them forget his prowess in war.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
Though casts have often been made of the reliefs on the
column—the earliest to the order of Francis I of France, in
1541—the best photographs were not taken until 1942, when
a scaffolding erected around the column to protect it from
air attack made close-ups possible. The <i>optimus princeps</i>
appears more than fifty times, larger than life. He dominates
the sea voyages (he handles the tiller personally), the
marches, the river-crossings, the councils of war, the reviews,
the encounters in the open field, the sieges, the sacrifices,
the submissions of enemy chiefs.</p>

<p>Because of the fascinating detail of the reliefs, Trajan’s
Column tells us as much about the Roman army and navy
as Pompeii and Ostia do about civilian life. Nor is this all:
we learn a great deal, too, about provincial and native customs
and culture. Most important, the unknown sculptor
has impressed his personality and his feelings upon what
he carved. There is an occasional touch of rough humor—a
slave falling off a mule, a Dacian ducked in the Danube—and
a scene or two in which Trajan, deprecating the humility
of submissive native chiefs, seems to be following Vergil’s
advice to spare the meek. But the dominant note is Vergil’s,
too: the horror of war. Some of the detail is worth recording.</p>

<p>The army and navy first. The transports, with cars in two
banks, and auxiliary sail, have ramming-beaks, adorned with
an enormous eye, for luck, or with a sea monster. The
soldiers are jacks-of-all-trades: we see them woodcutting
and reaping, but most often at the interminable work of
building palisaded camps, with tents of skins, a new camp
every night when they were on the march. They built their
permanent camps of squared stones: the sculptor shows the
soldiers carrying them in slings on their shoulders, or in
baskets. The walls had towers, with balconies, from which
flaming torches gave signals by night. Catapults were
mounted on the battlements; other catapults are horse or
mule drawn, or mounted on improvised wooden bases like
stacked railroad ties. We see the standards of the legions—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>the
famed Eagles—and the standard-bearers, wearing animal
heads for helmets, like Hercules. On the march the men
carry their gear in bundles on the ends of their pikes,
like tramps with their worldly goods done up in a bandanna.</p>

<p>We see something of provincial towns and their citizens.
The army embarked from an Adriatic port, Ancona or
Brindisi, and sailed across to Illyricum. Here the cities ape
Rome, with arches, columned temples, theaters, and amphitheaters.
The citizens turn out in a body, leading their
children by the hand, to greet their Emperor with upraised
right arms, as in a Fascist salute, and to offer sacrifice. The
Danube is crossed on a great bridge, the work of Apollodorus,
with masonry piers and wooden superstructure. Then one
is in wild country, with exotic flora and fauna, including an
especially bloodthirsty wild boar. The natives live in straw
huts, and wear trousers: this last, to a Roman, sure proof of
barbarism. In battle they use short hooked swords, and
carry sinister dragon-head standards. Their cavalry, horses
and all, are protected from head to foot with scaly armor.</p>

<p>It is exciting, but it is terrible. Dacian women burn Romans
alive; Romans impale the severed heads of Dacians
before the walls of their camp (<a href="#ip_10_9">Fig. 10.9</a>), or present them,
dripping with gore, to the Emperor. A Dacian is assassinated
with a sword thrust as he pleads for mercy. Bodies are
trampled underfoot in battle, prisoners are dragged along
by the hair. The Dacian king commits suicide rather than
fall into Roman hands; his subjects burn their capital to
the ground to deny it to the Romans. The story of the first
campaigns is separated from the second by a Victory writing
on a shield; immediately thereafter the deadly, monotonous
round begins again. The pathos of some of the scenes
heightens the horror, as when two comrades carry tenderly
from the field the limp body of a mortally wounded Dacian
youth, or a whole tribe, with babies in arms, or children
carried on their fathers’ shoulders, comes to make the act
of submission. At the end looting, with the Dacian treasure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
loaded on the backs of mules. These scenes, with their
implied criticism of warfare, are the closest the Romans
ever came to pacifism.</p>

<p>The province won with so much blood, sweat, and tears
by Trajan was consolidated by his successor Hadrian (who
had fought in the campaigns) and taught the arts of peace.
Hadrian, that restless traveler, spent little of his reign in
Rome, but he adorned the city with some of its grandest
buildings, for which he himself probably drew the plans,
and he built near suburban Tivoli a villa greater than Versailles.</p>

<span class="subhead">An Emperor-Architect: Hadrian</span></h2>
</div>

<p>About Trajan’s successor Hadrian (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 117–138) archaeology
and literature, interlocking, tell us so much that we can
write his biography from his buildings, with an occasional
assist from written sources. The buildings of his reign are
numerous and brilliantly designed. We shall take as examples
three from Rome and three from the unique complex
of his Villa near Tivoli: the Temple of Venus and Rome,
the Pantheon, and his mausoleum; the <i>Teatro Marittimo</i>,
the <i>Piazza d’Oro</i>, and the Canopus. All can be dated with
more precision than usual, because in Hadrian’s time the
practice became general of stamping bricks with the names
of the consuls of the year they were made. Professor Bloch’s
accurate study of, and sound inference from, over 4600
stamps, most of them from Hadrian’s reign, have put all
students of Roman archaeology deeply in his debt.</p>

<p>An attempt to understand Hadrian through his buildings
rests upon the hypothesis that he was himself his own
architect, inspired by the ferment of building activity in
Rome in Domitian’s and Trajan’s reigns, when he was growing
up. The hypothesis is perhaps justified by an inference
from an anecdote recorded by Dio Cassius, a Roman
senator and consul from Bithynia in northwest Asia Minor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
who wrote in Greek a history of Rome from the beginning
to <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 229. Dio’s story is that once when Trajan was in
conference with his architect, Apollodorus of Damascus,
Hadrian interrupted, and Apollodorus, angered, said, “Oh,
go and design your pumpkins!” We infer that Apollodorus’
reference to “pumpkins” was intended to pour scorn on
certain of Hadrian’s designs for vaults, involving pumpkin-like
concave segments with re-entrant groins between, such
as are still to be seen in Hadrian’s Villa, in the vestibule of
the Piazza d’Oro, and in the Serapeum at the end of the
Canopus (<a href="#ip_11_1">Fig. 11.1</a>). The same anecdote records that
Apollonius so piqued Hadrian, later, by his criticisms of the
design of the Emperor’s Temple of Venus and Rome, that
Hadrian had him first exiled and then put to death. This is
how Hadrian is established as an architect, and a vindictive
one at that.</p>

<p>Hadrian’s most baroque flights of architectural fancy are
to be seen at his villa near Tivoli, where the various complexes
of buildings are scattered over an area 1000 yards one
way by 500 yards the other. The buildings, which far outdid
Nero’s Golden House in extent and grandeur, include palaces,
large and small, for manic and for depressive moods
(plan [<a href="#ip_11_2">Fig. 11.2</a>] A,G,R,S,T,U,V,W), guest-quarters (B), a
pavilion (C), dining rooms (D,E,K), baths (F,O,P), a library
(the apsed building to the right of G), porticoes
(H,J), pools (between H and J, and northwest of X), slave
quarters (J,N), a stadium (L), many cryptoporticoes (for
example, M), firemen’s barracks (between A and M), a
palaestra or wrestling ground (Q), and a vaulted temple of
Serapis (X). Excavation, and the carrying off of statues,
with which Roman museums are crammed, began as early
as 1535, and continues to the present. It has been followed
by reconstruction (<a href="#ip_11_3">Fig. 11.3</a>) and general tidying up: the
Italian authorities report the clearing away of 13,200 pounds
of briers!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
The setting of Hadrian’s villa near Tivoli takes full advantage
of landscape: the view embraces mountains in one
direction, distant Rome and the sea in the other. There is
the color of pines, olives, ripe grain, pasture, and vineyard,
the sound of cicadas by day and nightingales at twilight.
And when the villa was new, everywhere was the sound of
water and the color of marble. For this enormous Folly, this
Roman Versailles, the immensity of all this space devoted
to the whims of one man, untrammelled by any limitations
of technique or money, is the perfected product of 200 years
of Roman experience in elegant country living. Its builder
occupied it but little. Eleven of the twenty-one restless
years of his reign were spent in foreign travel. He named
parts of his villa for famous buildings and places he had
seen in the Greek East: the Academy and the Painted Porch
(<i>Stoa Poecile</i>) in Athens, the Canopus near Alexandria. He
even created a mile of cryptoporticoes which he called a
“Hell” (<i>Inferi</i>, the Lower Regions): in his tortured life he
had been there, too, as we shall see. But the buildings are
idiosyncratic, not imitative, except in the creative Roman
way. Hadrian, the Spaniard, was quick to learn. He always
spoke Latin with an accent (his Greek was better), but his
architecture was pure Graeco-Roman, using the architectural
vocabulary of the past to create a new architectural language
of his own.</p>

<p>His earliest architectural essay at the villa, to judge from
the brick stamps, is the so-called “<i>Teatro Marittimo</i>” (the
round complex at G; see also <a href="#ip_11_4">Fig. 11.4</a>). Its earliest bricks
date from the first year of his reign. (Of course the bricks
need not have been used in the year they were made, and
indeed will often have been put aside for several years to
season.) Some bricks in the fabric of the <i>Teatro Marittimo</i>
are dated <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 123, an <i>annus mirabilis</i> in Roman brick production,
to meet the vast requirements of Hadrian’s many
projects, some ready to build, some still on the drawing-board.
These bricks point to later restorations of the original
plan, but the point here is that the fundamental design, very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
characteristic of Hadrian, must have been laid down early.
Much light on this complex, and on the villa as a whole,
has been cast by the sensitive, perceptive work of the
German Heinz Kähler, who, undaunted by the burning of
all his carefully drawn plans in World War II, redid and
published them in 1950, illuminating as never before our
picture of Hadrian as man and architect.</p>

<p>The entrance to the <i>Teatro Marittimo</i> was through a
portico to the north (at the bottom of the air photograph)
which approached a door in a high circular brick wall,
insuring complete privacy from the rest of the villa. Inside
the wall was a circular portico, concentric with the portico
a moat. The <i>Teatro Marittimo</i> is now restored (through the
philanthropy of an Italian tire manufacturer, impressed by
the likeness of its plan to his product), and the moat is filled
with water. When it was dry, its floor showed a pair of
grooves in an arc, one on either side of the main axis. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
grooves were made by the rollers of a drawbridge worked
from a small room on the edge of the inner circle. On the
site of one of the drawbridges there is now a permanent
foot-bridge, visible in the air photograph. On the circular
island, the columned arc between the drawbridges is a
vestibule where the Emperor might receive his friends. Beyond
it is a diamond-shaped peristyle, originally with a
fountain in the middle: its sides are segments of circles
which if projected would be tangent to the outer wall of the
moat. Beyond the peristyle is an apsidal room; the apse has
the same arc as the vestibule. This would be a pleasant
place for intimate dinner parties. The rooms on either side
might be bedrooms. A broad window opens from the dining
room onto the moat, with a view directly on an alcove let
into the circular wall on the axis of the far side. From the
alcove the view leads through eleven differently shaped and
differently lighted spaces back to the entrance portico and
a far-distant fountain to the north.</p>

<p>It remains to describe the rooms east and west of the
peristyle. The central apsidal room of the three on the west
(to the right of the peristyle in the air photograph) is a
deep bath with a window over the moat. Steps lead up to
the low sill: Hadrian could choose between tub and moat
for bathing. To the south is the dressing room, to the north
the steam bath and furnace room. East of the peristyle is a
circular room whose interior cross-walls form a double T,
creating two alcoves for reading. Each would be appropriate
to its season: the eastern for winter mornings and summer
afternoons, the western for summer mornings and winter
afternoons. The two adjoining rooms would be just right for
a small library, of some 1500 rolls, half Greek and half Latin;
the main library lay conveniently to the southwest (right
center in the air photograph). It is tempting to see in this
suite of rooms the study where the Emperor wrote his
resigned, sentimental, mannered little poem to his soul (or
is it to the soul of his beloved Antinous?):</p>

<p>This earliest Hadrianic building perfectly expresses one
aspect of the man: his genius, his moodiness, his striving for
form, his restlessness. With its wall, its moat, and its drawbridge,
it is all designed for privacy and quiet. From any
room one gets a view of variously lighted sections of space:
<i>chiaroscuro</i> to match moods grave and gay. In the midst of
axial symmetry, unrest is everywhere: in the curved forms,
in the abrupt switches from light to dark, from roofed
to open spaces, from horizontal architraves to the vertical
play of the central fountain. The unrest is central: the midpoint
is water and inaccessible. Tension and split are expressed
in the divided bridge approach. All is indirection,
schizophrenia, avoidance of forthrightness. As an architectural
exercise, it is uniquely abstract, a proposition of Euclid
in brick and marble, at one moment seeming to involve
nothing but circles, at another, nothing but squares. It is
probably no accident that its total diameter is almost exactly
the same as the Pantheon’s. It would have suited the complexity
of Hadrian’s mind to design a grandiose habitation
for all the gods to the self-same dimensions as this splendid
toy, the habitation of a restless, schizophrenic man whom his
subjects worshipped as a god. The gods had made Hadrian
in their own image; seconded by flattering courtiers, he was
returning the compliment.</p>

<p>The next building in Hadrian’s architectural biography
is his Temple of Venus and Rome, built facing the Coliseum
to rival the most splendid buildings of Athens and the Greek
East. Literary sources give its foundation date as Rome’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
birthday, April 21, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 121; the brick-stamps, of 123, 134,
and the fourth century, tell the story of long years of building
and late restoration. The restoration probably followed
Hadrianic lines; at any rate the proportion of straight to
curved profiles in the apses—exactly half and half—is Hadrianic
language, repeated in the Pantheon. The essence of the
plan is two apses back to back, one for Venus and one for
the goddess Roma. They may be interpreted as a colossal
architectural pun. Venus is a goddess of love, Love is AMOR,
and AMOR is ROMA spelled backward. The symbolism
does not stop here. Hadrian is Caesar: his is the heritage,
if not the blood, of the Julian line, and the temple is a reminder
of the greatness of Rome, firmly established by
Augustus, and smiled upon by Augustus’ ancestress, Venus.
The plan (<a href="#ip_11_5">Fig. 11.5</a> and 11.6) was ingenious and devious,
in Hadrian’s manner. The exterior is foursquare and conventional:
the interior, with its vaults and apses, was novel
and emphasized curves: compare the interplay of the square
and the round in the <i>Teatro Marittimo</i>. Daring as it was,
the design was the butt of the criticisms which cost Apollodorus
his life. He had said that the temple should have
been set on a high podium, which could have housed various
paraphernalia useful in the Coliseum opposite, and that the
vaulted apses had been designed too low for the statues in
them: “If the goddesses wish to get up and go out, they
will be unable to do so.” The first half of Apollodorus’ criticism
is unjustified: Hadrian was designing a Greek temple,
not an Italic one. About the second half we cannot judge,
for certain, for brick stamps show the apses to belong to the
fourth century reconstruction, but the proportions, as we
saw, are Hadrianic (<a href="#ip_11_7">Fig. 11.7</a>). The temple was set in the
midst of a forest of sixty-six columns of grey granite. When
it was re-excavated in 1932, some of the columns were re-erected;
the positions of others were ingeniously marked
by clumps of shrubbery trimmed to the proper shape. The
excavators found under the pavement an octagonal room<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
interesting in itself, and significant for its place in Roman
architecture. The level at which it was found is lower than
that of Nero’s Golden House. (Hadrian’s temple was built
in the grounds of what had once been the Golden House;
the reader will recall the twenty-four elephants needed to
move the colossal statue of Nero and make room for the
temple.) The octagonal shape appears in the dining room
of the Golden House itself, in Domitian’s palace on the
Palatine, and in a room in the Small Baths at Hadrian’s
villa (O on the plan, <a href="#ip_11_2">Fig. 11.2</a>). The cupola of Nero’s
octagonal dining room, together with its lighting through
a hole in the roof, reappears on a grand scale in the Pantheon.
This is what we mean by saying that Hadrian adapted to
his own new architectural language the vocabulary of pre-Neronian,
Neronian, and Domitianic buildings. Here once
again modern archaeology illuminates the development of
Roman architecture by demonstrating and dating the classical
use of new things in old ways, and old things in new.</p>

<p>Shortly after the consecration of the Temple of Venus and
Rome, Hadrian set out on the first of his great tours of his
Empire. He visited the western provinces, making arrangements,
among other things, for the building of the great
wall bearing his name that runs from Tyne to Solway in the
north of England. He visited the provinces of Africa, Cyrene
and Crete. Finally, in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 123, he reached Bithynia, and
there met Antinous (<a href="#ip_11_8">Fig. 11.8</a>), the sulky, langorous, adolescent
boy who, for the remaining seven years of his short
life, and even more after his tragic death by drowning—perhaps
suicide—in the suburb of Alexandria called Canopus,
was to dominate Hadrian’s existence and inspire his whole
creative activity. It is not surprising that the Emperor,
childless and unhappily married, should find deep satisfaction
in the company of this boy. The psychological aspects
of the affair, and the possible effect of Hadrian’s infatuation
upon his architecture have been treated with delicacy and
understanding by Marguerite Yourcenar and Eleanor Clark.</p>

<p>The first Hadrianic building that could have been designed
after the meeting with Antinous is the Pantheon
(<a href="#ip_11_9">Fig. 11.9</a>), “the oldest important roofed building in the
world that still stands intact.” On the evidence of the brick-stamps,
its framework was complete by <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 125, and the
whole building perhaps finished by 128. Until 1892 the
building passed as the work of Augustus’ lieutenant Agrippa,
because the inscription that runs across the architrave of the
rectangular porch in front of the drum, “Marcus Agrippa
built this when he was consul for the third time” (27 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>),
was taken at its face value. But in 1892 the entire fabric
was found to be full of stamped bricks of Hadrianic date,
and the building therefore Hadrianic throughout (with
Severan restorations, also recorded in an inscription). The
Agrippa inscription partly follows the Roman practice of
repeating the original dedication in a restored structure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
partly reflects the Emperor’s mock modesty. His involuted
nature found satisfaction in seldom inscribing his own name
on the buildings he designed. His contemporaries knew well
enough who the architect was. And the elaborate mystification
served also to point up his identifying himself with
Augustus, which we saw first in the Temple of Venus and
Rome. Whether Hadrian thought of himself as a new Augustus
or not, certainly Augustan domed buildings at the seaside
resort of Baiae, on the Bay of Naples, influenced his
architecture. Hadrian played the game out in the way he
handled the transition between the circular and the rectangular
parts of his plan (<a href="#ip_11_10">Fig. 11.10</a>). On either side of the
entrance to the drum, behind the porch, he designed rectangular
projections with huge half-vaulted apses cut out
of the front: one of these apses would have contained a
statue of Agrippa, the other of Augustus. And Romans passing
between them (through the great bronze entrance doors
that still survive) would marvel at how self-effacing was
their Emperor-architect.</p>

<p>The interior (<a href="#ip_11_11">Fig. 11.11</a>) carries forward that liberation
of religious architecture from the Greek tyranny of the rectangular
box, which can only come about through the use
of poured concrete, and which we saw first in the Sanctuary
of Fortune at Praeneste. Here Hadrian plays with geometrical
abstractions, as in the Teatro Marittimo. The game is to
describe a sphere in a cylinder: if the curve of the dome
were projected beyond the point where it meets the vertical
walls of the drum, the bottom of the curve would be just
tangent with the floor. The very pavement, with its alternation
of squares and circles, plays up the geometrical <i>jeu
d’esprit</i>. (Beneath this pavement lies the simple rectangular
plan of Agrippa’s temple.) Furthermore, both the plan and
the interior view show that the walls of the drum are not
solid, and that they continue the architect’s vast toying with
geometrical concepts. The walls are lightened with niches
(for statues; one, of Venus, wore Cleopatra’s pearls in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
ears). The niches are alternately rectangular and curved; the
result is that the hemispherical cupola is supported not on
a solid wall but on eight huge piers. In order to reduce the
bearing weight of the superstructure upon the niches, into
the concrete fabric above the apertures were built, concealed
by polychrome marble revetment, elaborate brick
relieving arches, which run as barrel vaults right through
the walls. The cupola itself is designed with sunken stepped
coffers, to lighten it, and to exaggerate the perspective, and
to play yet again with the alternation of curve and straight
line. The concrete of the cupola, which is thinner toward
the top, is made with pumice, the lightest material available.
But in spite of the pains taken to lighten the enormous mass,
the piers gave under the weight of the cupola, and external
buttresses proved necessary (see plan, <a href="#ip_11_10">Fig. 11.10</a>), which
spoiled the exterior effect. Hadrian is an amateur to the end;
his vaults do not hold, his cupolas need bracing, his foundations
give—and yet the essence of his designs has lasted
forever.</p>

<p>The Pantheon is lighted solely through the great hole,
thirty feet across, at the top of the cupola. (The building is
so large that the inconvenience from rain is negligible.) The
best possible idea of the perfection of this great building
is to be gained by looking down into the interior from high
above, from the edge of the hole in the roof. This dizzy
height, at which one may glory or despair according to the
measure of one’s acrophobia, is reached by a stair behind
the left apse in the porch. The stair gives access to the
cornice at the top of the drum; one then walks half-way
round the cornice, which is wide but unrailed, to the back
of the drum, where a flight of steps, only half-railed, leads
up over the lead plates (the original gilt bronze was sent
to Constantinople in the seventh century), to the aperture,
from which those with a head for heights can gauge the
aesthetic satisfaction of realizing that the interior is exactly
as high as it is wide. The total effect, massive, daring, playing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
with space, yet not entirely successful technically, reflects
the man.</p>

<p>One wonders what Hadrian’s tortured and cynical spirit
would make of the vicissitudes his building has suffered. A
Barberini pope in the seventeenth century used the bronze
of the porch roof to make the canopy over the high altar of
St. Peter’s, and guns for the papal fortress, Castel Sant’
Angelo (which had once been Hadrian’s mausoleum); of
this vandalism the wags of 1625 made the famous epigram,
“<i>Quod non fecerunt barbari fecerunt Barberini</i>,” which
might be paraphrased, “The Barberini rush in where barbarians
fear to tread.” At the same time Bernini added a pair
of ridiculous bell towers—called “the ass’s ears”—which were
not taken down until the nineteenth century. Perhaps
Hadrian would be better pleased to know that men like
himself were buried in his building: a great creative artist—Raphael—and
two Italian kings.</p>

<p>While the Pantheon was being built, an activity unexampled
in the history of Roman architecture was going on
at the villa. To the fruitful years after 125 belongs the
uniquely inspired plan (<a href="#ip_11_12">Fig. 11.12</a>) of the most important
palace in the villa complex, called the <i>Piazza d’Oro</i>, the
Golden Square. Its “pumpkin” vestibule (K in the plan)
has already been mentioned. In many of its features, including
the hole in the roof, the eight supporting piers, and
the alternation of curved and rectilinear niches, it is a
quarter-scale Pantheon, but there is greater frankness in
the display of the structure, both internally, in the groined
vault, and externally, where the octagonal plan is left clearly
visible, instead of being concealed by the skin of the drum,
as in the Pantheon. Except perhaps for the cross-vaulted
passages N,N, the portico is conventional; excavation in the
summer of 1958 revealed footings for formal flower beds,
as in the portico of Pompey’s theater, and in Vespasian’s
Forum of Peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
The part of the complex which shows Hadrian’s full
genius is the palace-block, south of the portico (plan A-I).
Here the vastness, sweep, and richness of the <i>Piazza d’Oro</i>
comes to its climax in a design which has been called lyrical,
feminine, and even Mozartian. Here, if anywhere, can be
detected the influence of Antinous. The frieze-motif, for
example, is Cupids (riding sea-monsters), but since this
theme is borrowed from the <i>Teatro Marittimo</i>, which, at
least in its earliest phase, antedates Antinous, too much
should not be made of it. The center of the composition is
the four-leaf-clover room at A, with a fountain in the middle.
Its walls sweep in and out, with a sinuous, wave-like movement,
as though the room were alive, and breathing. The
outswinging arcs open into light-wells (C,C; B is a curved
nymphaeum, with statue-niches alternately curved and rectilinear,
from beneath which the water flowed down steps
into a reflecting pool; the fourth side is the entrance). The
inswinging arcs open into bell-shaped rooms (a,a,a,a). These
serve to counter the thrust of the centrally-pierced cupola
(see the reconstruction, <a href="#ip_11_13">Fig. 11.13</a>), which may have successfully
solved the problem of transition from octagonal
ground-plan to circular dome. The cupola was supported
(none too well, for it has fallen and left no trace) on eight
delicate piers, in what we now see to be Hadrian’s standard
but ever-varied manner. The six tiny apsidal rooms (b) are
latrines; their water-supply came from fountains at the back
of the bell-shaped diagonal rooms, yet another example of
the Roman combination of the useful with the ornamental.</p>

<p>Off the central clover-leaf open on each side five rectangular
rooms (I is a late addition), all but one barrel-vaulted;
the exception (G) had a cross-vault. Each set opens
onto a light well. At the back of the central room (E) in
each set is a statue-niche. The view from the back of these
rooms runs, as in the <i>Teatro Marittimo</i>, through variegated
light and shade. E was diagonally lit from the light-well;
the light-well itself, a variant on the conventional atrium,
had probably a square <i>compluvium</i>, or open skylight; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
central room was lit by the round cupola-aperture, and so
on. The whole design, with its indirect lighting, plays of
water, and works of art, is light and gay, reflecting the
Emperor’s brief years of pleasure with his <i>inamorato</i>; what
the Empress Sabina thought is not recorded. But here again
is the tension that comes from an inaccessible midpoint.
And whose statues were in the niches? Whatever may have
been the case in Antinous’ lifetime, after his death Hadrian
deified him, identifying him with Apollo, Dionysus, Hermes,
Silvanus, Osiris, and other gods, and surrounded himself
with reminders of him in marble. Of the statues of Antinous
in Roman museums, a number variously estimated at from
sixteen to thirty comes from the villa.</p>

<p>Hadrian’s happiness was short-lived. In <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 128 he set
out again on his travels, accompanied by Antinous. They
wintered at Athens, which Hadrian enriched with monuments,
passed over into Asia Minor, and down through Syria
into Egypt. Here, in 130, Antinous died, probably a suicide,
to please his master or to avoid his passion. Hadrian’s grief
was more baroque than any of his buildings. From this point
his life becomes one long death-wish. The most massive symbol
of this is his mausoleum, whose great concrete drum,
approached by Hadrian’s bridge, the <i>Pons Aelius</i> (nowadays
the Ponte Sant’ Angelo) still dominates the right bank
of the Tiber near St. Peter’s. The latest Hadrianic bricks in
it are dated <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 134; it must have become an important part
of the Emperor’s plans when he returned to Rome, mourning
Antinous, in 132 or 133. Its plan goes back to Etruscan
<i>tumuli</i>, via the Mausoleum of Augustus—creative imitation
again. The square block on which the drum rests has almost
exactly the dimensions of the Augustan monument’s
diameter. A spiral ramp leads up to the tomb chamber in
the very center of the drum. The top was spread with earth
and planted with cypresses, the trees of death (<a href="#ip_11_14">Fig. 11.14</a>),
and the whole surmounted by a colossal group in bronze,
perhaps of Hadrian in a four-horse chariot, now replaced by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
the archangel Michael, who gives the mausoleum its present
name, Castel Sant’ Angelo. When the death he longed
for agonizingly came, from dropsy, in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 138, Hadrian’s
ashes were laid beside those of the wife he had never loved,
in the core of the monument which symbolized his despair
at the death of the only creature to whom this strange man
had ever given his affection. The great pile has been successively
fortress, prison (immuring, among others, the
great Renaissance scientist Giordano Bruno), and, since
1934, military museum.</p>

<p>But before his death Hadrian dedicated one more section
of the villa to mourning his loss. This is the Canopus (Figs.
<a href="#ip_11_1">11.1</a> and <a href="#ip_11_15">11.15</a>), named for the suburb of Alexandria where
Antinous met his untimely and unhappy end. The original
plan may have antedated Antinous’ death—the latest stamps
reported by Bloch are dated <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 126—but after the disaster
Hadrian, deliberately turning the knife in the wound, must
have made this complex a memorial of the place where it
happened. For the approach is along a pool (excavated and
restored 1954–1957) intended to be reminiscent of the canal
which gave access to the Canopus at Alexandria. The latest
finds make it possible to restore the pool with its south end
fitted with dining couches. The north end is apsidal, edged
with a curious colonnade whose architrave is flat over one
pair of columns and arched over the next pair. Along the
sides were found perfect (and entirely unimaginative)
copies of the Caryatids, the maidens who upheld the south
porch of the Erechtheum; these would be memories of past
happiness in Athens. Flanking the maidens were Sileni.
Other marbles, adorning the apsidal north end of the colonnade,
included, in order, an Amazon, a Hermes, a river god
representing the Tiber, another representing the Nile, an
Ares, and another Amazon. All this uninspired archaism is
depressing; in the ageing, heartbroken Hadrian taste and
inspiration alike are dead.</p>

<p>The colonnade led to the terminal half-dome (another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
“pumpkin,” it will be recalled) and secondary structures,
the whole long known as the Serapeum (there was such a
temple in the Alexandrian Canopus). It is complex in plan,
at once <i>nymphaeum</i> and temple, with its hemicycle deepened
at the back into a long narrow apsidal gallery in which
some commentators have seen a deep sexual significance.
Here Hadrian has turned, to catalyze his flagging inspiration,
to older civilizations, dead or dying like himself. Once
again, for the last time, and feebly, he has made of what
they have to offer something uniquely his own. In the Canopus,
as in the Teatro Marittimo and the Piazza d’Oro, there
is no single satisfactory viewpoint: the result is an effect of
motion, in curved space, in varied light and shade, involved
with water, the whole a polyphonic counterpart to Hadrian’s
own restlessness.</p>

<p>The buildings we have studied present a partial portrait
of the man. Hadrian the hunter, the soldier, the statesman
comes out clearly in reliefs, coins, and inscriptions we have
not room to treat. But the buildings reflect the dilettante
Hadrian, uneasy, moody, whimsical, formal, distant, unapproachable,
tense, self-conscious, cold. They show many
facets of his character: in the Teatro Marittimo, his love of
privacy, and his restlessness; in the Temple of Venus and
Rome, the neat, abstract quality of his mind, his sense of
humor, his self-conscious pairing of himself with Augustus;
in the Pantheon, abstraction and Augustus again, plus an
awareness of his own grandeur; in the Piazzo d’Oro, complication,
involution, febrile gaiety. In the mausoleum, the
obsession with his own grandeur and with the memory of
Augustus recur, and something new has been added: death-wish
and posturing with grief. These last two attitudes are
to be read again in the fabric of the Canopus, together with
a failure of creativity which marks the beginning of the end.</p>

<p>Hadrian is not the only Emperor whose personality may
be read in the artifacts of his reign, but he is unique in
being himself his own architect. This in turn creates a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
problem. How much in his work is genuine self-expression,
how much mere playing with form? But the very putting
of the question gives insight into Hadrian’s character. The
key is schizophrenia: unrest and self-consciousness where
there might have been the easy confidence born of unchallenged
Empire; loneliness in the midst of a crowded court;
genius that failed; a love that killed. These are the contradictions
that have caused Hadrian to be saluted—a dubious
compliment—as “the first modern man.” In his architecture,
perhaps more eloquently and poignantly than in any other
Roman work, the mute stones speak.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>With Hadrian an era ends. Juvenal, who wrote during
his reign, is the last secular classical Latin poet of importance.
Hadrian’s successor, Antoninus Pius (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 138–161)
was modest and plain-living where Hadrian had been flamboyant
and extravagant. The autobiography (written in
Greek) of <i>his</i> successor, Marcus Aurelius (161–180), is
throughout a tacit criticism of Hadrian: his boy-love, his
architecture, his dilettantism. Marcus Aurelius’ son and
successor, Commodus (180–192), was a monstrous megalomaniac
beside whose excesses those of Caligula, Nero, or
Domitian pale into insignificance. The next dynasty, the
Severi (193–235), founded a military absolutism which degenerated
into anarchy (235–284). Under Diocletian (284–305)
absolutism is intensified and grows more rigid. Under
Constantine (306–337) the Empire’s creative center shifts
to Constantinople (old Byzantium made new, in the Greek
east), a new religion triumphs, and the story of Christian
archaeology begins. True, the two centuries from Hadrian
through Constantine are represented by some of Rome’s
most impressive surviving monuments: the Temple of Antoninus
and Faustina, the Column of Marcus Aurelius,
the Arches of Septimius Severus and of Constantine, the
Baths of Caracalla and Diocletian, Aurelian’s Wall, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
the Basilica of Maxentius. But, artistically, many of these
are derivative; <i>e.g.</i>, Marcus Aurelius’ Column imitates
Trajan’s; Constantine’s arch incorporates reliefs from earlier,
more creative reigns. Yet while the artistic impulse flickers
and dies, Roman skill in military and civil engineering, as
exemplified in baths and aqueducts, roads and walls, continues
unabated.</p>

</div>

<p>In this chapter strict chronology must be violated, and steps
retraced, to discuss in specific detail something of what
archaeology has to tell us about the most practical aspect
of the Romans’ genius: their talent for engineering. This
is best exemplified in roads, baths, aqueducts, and fortification-walls.</p>

<p>We have reached in our historical survey the end of
Hadrian’s reign, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 138. By this date the main lines of
the great consular roads leading from Rome had all been
laid down, and later Emperors faced only the problems of
maintenance, till the barbarians cut Rome’s lines of communication,
and the moving of the administrative center
to Milan, Ravenna, and Constantinople reduced their importance.
The most recent archaeological investigation of
Roman roads in Italy has concentrated on tracing the lines
of major and minor Roman highways and the native tracks
that preceded them, a work of great urgency, in view of the
modernization which is rapidly changing the face of Italy,
especially in the vicinity of Rome.</p>

<p>If we turn to Roman baths, like those of Caracalla in
Rome, begun in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 211, we are back on the chronological
track again, but we find that the last major archaeological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
work upon them was done at the end of the last century,
and that their chief interest today lies in the inspiration
they have offered to modern architects.</p>

<p>As for aqueducts, the last important ancient one was
built under the Emperor Alexander Severus, in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 226,
but working back from that date we can profitably review
the difficult and absorbing topographical work done in tracing
the courses of the major aqueducts by a devoted Englishman
and an American woman.</p>

<p>Finally we shall review the work of another Englishman
in tracing the chronology and building techniques of ancient
Rome’s last great fortification, Aurelian’s Wall, begun
in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 271 and still in large part standing. Its alterations
and repairs have been traced down to the middle of the
sixth century of our era. The examples chosen should justify
the Romans’ high reputation for engineering skill, and
illuminate Roman history, at the same time underlining
on the one hand our debt, for the facts we know and the
inferences we draw, to the careful work of modern archaeologists,
and on the other the catalytic effect, in the case of
the baths, of Roman work upon our own architecture of the
day before yesterday.</p>

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 12.1</span> Roman road construction. (U.S. Bureau of Public Roads)</div></div>

<p>Roman roads (see <a href="#ip_4_1">Fig. 4.1</a>) echoing to the measured
tread of marching legions, had made a large contribution
to unifying Italy by the time the last great consular highway,
the Via Aemilia, opened up the Po valley from Ariminum
to Placentia in 187 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, but their work of carrying
commerce and ideas was unceasing. Of course there were
roads in Italy before the Romans: the name and route of
the Via Salaria, from the salt-pans at the Tiber’s mouth
up the valley into the Apennines, suggest that it must have
been in use since prehistoric times. The Via Latina, named
not for a Roman consul but for a people potent in central
Italy until the Romans broke their league in 338 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, must
count as a pre-Roman road, and its winding course along
the foothills must antedate the draining of the Pomptine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
marshes and the laying down of the straight course across
them from Rome to Tarracina and thence to Capua of the
<i>regina viarum</i>, the queen of roads, the Via Appia. It bears
the name of a Roman censor of 312 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> This is the first of
the great highways, and it deserves its fame for its bold
conquest of natural obstacles, its arrow-straight course
across the marshes, but its gravel surface was not replaced
by stone pavement until 293 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, and then only as far as
the suburb of Bovillae. And its course, like that of many
another Roman road, was not always so arrow-straight.
In the hills behind Tarracina it followed the contours; it
was not until Trajan’s time that another bold stroke of engineering
cut through the high, rocky Pesco Montano to
let the road pass by the more direct coastal route. (Some
authorities hold that the Romans preferred straight roads
because the front axles of their vehicles were rigid.) Trajan’s
engineers showed their pride in their work by incising
monumental Roman numerals, still visible, to mark the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
depth of the cut every ten feet from the top down, until
the road level was triumphantly reached at CXX.</p>

<p>Along the Appia, and the other consular roads radiating
from Rome, traces of the ancient stone paving are occasionally
preserved. The paving blocks are usually <i>selce</i>
(flint), polygonal in shape and closely fitted without mortar.
While most Roman roads prove on archaeological examination
to consist of paving blocks laid in a trench and packed
with earth and <i>selce</i> chips, it will be worthwhile to record
the ideal method of laying a pavement—strictly speaking
a mosaic pavement—as recommended by the architect Vitruvius,
a contemporary of Augustus. The method illustrates
the Roman engineer’s infinite capacity for taking
pains.</p>

<p>After the field engineer (1 in the reconstruction, <a href="#ip_12_1">Fig. 12.1</a>),
assisted by the stake man (2), had aligned the road
with his <i>groma</i>, he ran levels with the <i>chorobates</i> (3) with
the roadman’s help (4). A plow (5) was used to loosen
earth and mark road margins; then workmen dug marginal
trenches (6) to the depth desired for the solid foundations.
Laborers (7) shoveled loose earth and carried it away in
baskets. The next step was to consolidate the roadbed with
a tamper (8). Now the roadbed was ready for its foundation,
the <i>pavimentum</i> (9), lime mortar or sand laid to
form a level base. Next came the <i>statumen</i>, or first course
(10), fist-size stones, cemented together with mortar or
clay, the thickness varying from ten inches to two feet.
Over this was laid the <i>rudus</i> or second course (11), nine
to twelve inches of lime concrete, grouted with broken
stone and pottery fragments. Next the <i>nucleus</i>, or third
course (12), concrete made of gravel or coarse sand mixed
with hot lime, placed in layers and compacted with a roller.
Its thickness was one foot at the sides, eighteen inches at
the crown of the road. Finally, the <i>summum dorsum</i> or top
course (13), polygonal blocks of <i>selce</i> six inches or more
thick, carefully fitted and set in the <i>nucleus</i> while the concrete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
was still soft. Sometimes, when archaeologists have
taken up a stretch of Roman road, they have found the
<i>selce</i> blocks rutted on the under side: the economical contractors,
happily untroubled by high-priced labor, had
repaired their road by turning the worn blocks upside down.
Standard curbs (14a and b) were two feet wide and
eighteen inches high; paved footpaths (15a and b) often
ran outside them. Conduits (16) under the curb, with
arched outlets (17) opening beside the right of way, took
care of draining surface water. Milestones (18) marked
the distance from Rome and the name of the Emperor responsible
for repairs. From the names of successive Emperors
on milestones of the same road, archaeologists have
calculated that the average life of a highway was thirty
to forty years.</p>

<p>Two points should be emphasized: first, this represents
an ideal method of construction, not often exemplified in
practice; second, to a modern engineer a road like this
would seem insufficiently elastic, a five-foot wall in the flat,
too rigid for the stresses and strains to which it was subjected.
Hence perhaps the frequent need for repairs, but
Roman traffic was lighter than ours, and the very fact that
we can write about the roads at all is a tribute to their durability.
Upon roads like these, under the Empire, travelled
the Imperial posting service, with relays of messengers, and
post-houses where horses and carriages could be changed.
Under exceptional conditions the Emperor Tiberius, using
this service, once travelled 180 miles in a day, a rate of
speed not equalled on European roads until the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>The next major road laid out after the Appia must have
been the Valeria, which was needed for eastward communication
via Tivoli with the new colony of Alba Fucens,
founded, as we saw, in 303 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Archaeology has shown
that in general the foundation of a colony precedes the laying
down of the metalled military road. This is true of Cosa<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
(foundation date of the colony, 273 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>; probable date of
the Via Aurelia which served it, about 241); of Ariminum
(founded 268 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>; reached by the Via Flaminia in 220),
and of the Roman colonies in the Po valley; <i>e.g.</i>, Bononia
(Bologna: founded 189 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>; reached by the Via Aemilia
after 187). The full extension of the Via Valeria beyond
Alba to the Adriatic had to await the pacification of the
Samnite tribes of central Italy and the granting of citizenship
to Italians after the “Social” War, in 89 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Milestones
on this last stretch belong to Claudius’ reign (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 41–54).</p>

<p>A recent (1957) survey of the central section of the
Valeria by the Dutch scholar C. C. Van Essen illustrates the
methods and results of archaeologists working in the field
with topographical problems. Faced with the palimpsest
of more than two millennia overlying the road he wanted
to trace, Van Essen paid particular attention to such roadmarks
as Roman milestones; ancient tombs (which regularly
lined Roman roads in the vicinity of towns); supporting
walls, in Roman headers-and-stretchers; rock-hewn
causeways; bridges, where Roman materials and workmanship
can be distinguished from modern (as has been recently
done for the bridges of the Via Flaminia by Michael
Ballance of the British School at Rome; there the striking
thing is the predominance and good quality of the work
done under Augustus, who had a vested interest in assuring
efficient communications with his veterans dispersed in
colonies in north Italy). Stretches of ancient pavement are
rare on the Valeria, having been destroyed by medieval and
modern resurfacing, by the plow, and by torrents and earthquakes,
but the trench in which it was bedded can often
be distinguished on air photographs. What struck Van
Essen chiefly was the frequency with which the ancient
Via Valeria would run straight on, with steep gradients,
where the modern road resorts to sweeping curves or hairpin
bends. Ancient vehicles, the heaviest of which were
perhaps only a quarter the weight of a modern light European<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
car (Roman wagon, perhaps 440 pounds; Volkswagen,
1650), and scarcely ever carried loads of over 1100 pounds,
would be less troubled by steep gradients than a modern
heavy truck. Even so, at Tagliacozzo, about six miles on the
Rome side of Alba Fucens, the grade is so steep that
Van Essen supposes the ancient inhabitants hired out oxen
to help the straining horses on the upslope. Van Essen
noted that the telegraph lines, following the comparatively
straight course of the ancient road, often gave a clue to
its presence. The ancient sixty-eighth milestone of the Valeria,
found, as we saw, within the walls of Alba Fucens,
provides a good comparison of the respective lengths of
the ancient and the modern roads. Since the Roman mile
(4861 English feet) was slightly shorter than the English,
sixty-eight Roman miles corresponds to slightly over sixty-two
English miles, whereas the modern Via Valeria covers
about 113 kilometers, or approximately seventy miles, to
reach Alba.</p>

<p>Archaeologists have not confined their interests to the
great consular roads. Minor highways in areas away from
the main stream of traffic are often more rewarding, since
they tend to be better preserved, and offer some chance to
trace the pre-Roman systems that underlie or intersect them.
The district just north of Rome has been surveyed in this
way by members of the British School at Rome since 1954,
only just in time, for there prevails in this region a situation
analogous to the rapid disappearance of Indian remains
in the American West with the building of the great hydroelectric
dams. In the country north of Rome, since World
War II, there has been an extensive program of land expropriation,
reclamation, and resettlement of small farmers,
an excellent thing for rehabilitating the Italian peasantry,
but fatal for archaeological remains, since the plan involves
the use of the deep plow, an ideal instrument for obliterating
traces of ancient roadways. Thus it is that members
and friends of the British School, spurred on by the Director,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
John Ward Perkins, a worthy successor of the indefatigable
Thomas Ashby, are to be seen braving wind and
weather as they scour the countryside for Roman and pre-Roman
roads from Veii to beyond Cività Castellana, armed
with large-scale maps, air photographs, and brown paper
bags for collecting the potsherds which are the evidence of
ancient roadside habitation.</p>

<p>The British School’s most significant recent work has
been carried on from Nepi, a Roman colony allegedly of
383 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, twenty-eight miles north-northwest of Rome, and
Falerii Novi, about four miles farther north. Falerii Novi
was built by the Romans from the ground up in 241 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
to house the inhabitants of Falerii Veteres (Cività Castellana)
a hostile native Faliscan center, which the Romans
completely destroyed. But the old city must have been
resettled, for ruts in the third century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> road connecting
the new city with the old are not of standard Roman width,
and were probably made by Faliscan wagons. The <i>cardo</i>
of the new settlement is formed by a new road connection
with the south, the Via Amerina (<a href="#ip_12_2">Fig. 12.2</a>); in the course
of exploring this the British archaeologists found traces from
which the older road system (<a href="#ip_12_3">Fig. 12.3</a>) which it partially
supplanted, may be inferred. At Torre dell’ Isola, just north
of Nepi, for example, they found, by the wall of a medieval
castle, sherds with the cord-impressed chevrons characteristic
of Villanovan ware, and part of one of the portable
hearths which we met first in the primitive hut on the
Palatine in Rome. These sherds provide evidence for habitation
here at least as early as on the Palatine. The discovery
of similar sherds within the walls of Etruscan Veii
suggests a people inferior culturally to the Etruscans, and
probably living in subjection to them.</p>

<div id="ip_12_2" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 31.6875em;">

  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 12.2</span> Roman roads of the <i>ager Faliscus</i>.
(<i>Papers Brit. Sch. at Rome</i> 12 [1957], p. 68)</div></div>

<p>These people were the Faliscans. Their settlements must
have required road connections, especially between their
chief city, old Falerii, and Veii, with which it was allied.
These roads the British archaeologists have identified in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
deep cuttings, identified as pre-Roman by inscriptions in
Etruscan characters. (Faliscan was a dialect of Latin, but
Etruscan inscriptions occur.) These earliest cuttings, sometimes
nearly fifty feet deep, are driven impressively through
cliffs, cut downward from the surface in a succession of
working levels to match the slope of the finished road, with
careful attention paid to drainage. Pre-Roman stone piers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
probably carried timber bridges, but most of the roads are
mere ridgeway tracks, not unlike the medieval and modern
farm tracks still to be found in the district. The Faliscans
were apparently capable of ambitious engineering, but were
driven by poverty to avoid it. The Romans used Faliscan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
cuttings when they found it convenient, it being their way
to take things as they found them, introducing modifications
only to the minimum extent necessary to suit their own
needs.</p>

<div id="ip_12_3" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 31.1875em;">
  <img src="images/i_095b.jpg" width="499" height="700" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 12.3</span> Faliscan roads of the <i>ager Faliscus</i>.
(<i>PBSR</i>, <i>loc. cit.</i>, p. 105)</div></div>

<p>The most interesting and the most certainly identified
Faliscan roads discovered in the British survey are in the
neighborhood of Grotta Porciosa, a fortified site about four
miles north-northeast of Cività Castellana and a mile and
a half west of the Tiber. It controlled the ridge between
two gorges, a natural route for a cross-country road between
the Tiber and the towns of Gallese, Corchiano, and Cività
Castellana. In these towns the Romans had no interest: the
two main Roman roads in this area run not cross-country
but north and south, the Via Flaminia close to the Tiber,
the Via Amerina on the high ground five or six miles to
the west. These roads bypassed all the towns just mentioned.
But the cross-country tracks, on which the local
inhabitants would travel, are visible both in air-photographs
and on the ground, where they show no trace of Roman
paving. At Grotta Porciosa itself, excavation would be required
to reach the early Faliscan level; the majority of
sherds found is local black glaze of a quite late pre-Roman
period (mid-third century <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>).</p>

<p>What is most striking about the British results is the contrast
they point up between native and Roman. Where the
native tracks usually follow the line of least resistance, the
Roman Via Amerina is driven across any obstacle, with
what Ward Perkins aptly calls “ruthless thoroughness,”
whenever there is no reasonable alternative. One might
almost think that the new road was built deliberately to
impress; in any case the massive viaducts and lofty bridges
served to symbolize to the Faliscan peasantry the Roman
conqueror’s energy and resources, by which it was hopelessly
outclassed. With the same ruthlessness with which
they imposed their roads upon the landscape, the Romans
imposed law and order upon the countryside. The archaeological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
evidence is the way in which the peasants shifted
from their old anarchical life in small strongholds of armed
retainers, which is what Grotta Porciosa must have been,
down into settled life in Roman cities, or in the open country
beside the Roman roads. The great primeval Ciminian
Forest, northwest of Nepi, once the fearsome haunt of
brigands, was cleared under the Romans and turned into
farms. When after eight centuries Roman power waned,
the countryside reverted to pre-Roman conditions; the
country-folk crept back into the cliff-top villages, there to
remain until quite recent times.</p>

<p>These, the results of careful and enjoyable outdoor work
in the Italian countryside by a United Nations of archaeologists,
enable us to appreciate how the competence of
the Roman road-builders made possible both the cold-bloodedness
of the Roman conquest and the security of the
Roman peace.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>That security brought in its train prosperity, and even
luxury, of which the symbol is the grandiose Roman public
baths. Though Agrippa, Nero, Titus, and Trajan all built
baths whose sites and plans are known, the most grandiose,
and the clearest in plan, are the Baths of Caracalla,
begun in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 211. The Baths of Diocletian, built a century
later, are equally vast, but their plan has been obscured
by the incorporation into their fabric of the church of S.
Maria degli Angeli and the Terme Museum. The Baths of
Caracalla, known to thousands of visitors as the summer
setting for Rome’s outdoor opera, were built on a vast platform,
twenty feet high, with an area of 270,000 square feet,
greater than that of London’s Houses of Parliament. Excavations
in 1938, when the Baths were being prepared for
their metamorphosis into an outdoor opera house, revealed
in the substructure vaulted service corridors, wide enough
for vehicles, widening out at intersections into regular underground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
public squares, with provisions for rotary traffic.
Access to the lower reaches was by stairs let into the central
piers of the main building. The principal entrance to the
baths was to the north (over the edge of the platform at
the top center of the air-photograph, <a href="#ip_12_4">Fig. 12.4</a>). It was
flanked by numerous small rooms which in the difficult
post-war years housed teeming families of Italy’s homeless.
(Their unique opportunity of a summer evening to admire
the sleek prosperity of the operagoers recreated the gulf
that yawned between haves and have nots in Imperial
Rome, and contributed not a little to Italy’s unrest.)</p>

<p>The main bath building was set in the northern half of
the great open space provided by the platform, and was
surrounded with gardens. Facing these on the perimeter
was a variety of halls, for lectures, reading, and exercise.
Those on the east and west were contained in curved projections
(exedras). A part of the western exedra appears
in the lower left corner of the air-photograph. Beneath it
in a subterranean vault was discovered in 1911 what was
at that time the largest Mithraeum (shrine of the Persian
god Mithras) in Rome.<a id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> To the south (lower right on the
photograph) was a stadium whose seats were built against
the reservoir which supplied the baths: this was fed by a
branch from one of the great aqueducts, the Aqua Marcia.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_E" href="#FNanchor_E" class="fnanchor">E</a> In 1958 Dutch archaeologists excavated a larger one under the church

<p>The main block of the baths is distinguished for its axial
symmetry. The most prominent room was the circular <i>caldarium</i>,
or hot bath (just to the right of center in the photograph).
It is between its main piers that the opera stage
is set. Behind it the vast rectangular open space (82 × 170
feet) is most logically interpreted as a grand concourse
whence the patrons of the baths (as many as 1600 in peak
hours) could move unimpeded to the bathing rooms of
their choice. This central room was groin-vaulted in coffered
concrete, in three great bays supported by eight piers
(<a href="#ip_12_5">Fig. 12.5</a>). The rooms around the central rectangle, with
their enormously thick walls, were ingeniously arranged as
buttresses to resist the thrust of the colossal vaults.</p>

The large open spaces at the east and west ends of the
main block were exercise-grounds. The exedras adjacent to
their inner sides were decorated in the early fourth century
with the splendidly satiric mosaics of athletes now in the
Lateran Museum. With their broken noses, low foreheads,
and cauliflower ears, they are the very type of overspecialized
brutal brawn which intellectuals in all ages have delighted
to ridicule.</p>

cold swimming pool, or <i>frigidarium</i>; perhaps the rooms on
either side were dressing rooms. Below the pavement of
the baths the excavators discovered tons of L- or T-shaped
iron bolted together in the form of a St. Andrew’s cross.
The possible inference is that some part of the baths was
roofed with iron girders, designed to support bronze plates
ingeniously contrived to reflect sunlight onto the bathers
below. (The evidence for the bronze plates and the sunroom
is not archaeological but literary, and, chiefly because
the literary source had little or no idea what he was talking
about, has raised apparently insoluble controversy.)</p>

<p>Excavations were going on in the Baths on a langorous
summer afternoon in late June of 1901 which the American
architect Charles Follen McKim spent there. That
afternoon bore fruit soon after, when he was asked to design
for the Pennsylvania Railroad a great terminal station
in New York. McKim, lover of Rome and founder of the
American Academy there, belonged to the school of architects
for whom the grand manner, as found in Roman
baths, the Pantheon, and the Coliseum, formed the basis
of design for works of the first rank. He desired to symbolize
in Pennsylvania Station the monumental gateway to a
great city, which should at the same time perform efficiently
its function of handling large crowds. To a man of his training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
and prejudices, the Baths of Caracalla seemed to fill
the bill. He is reported to have assembled on one occasion
a huge band of workmen in the Baths in Rome, simply to
test the aesthetic effect of huge scale upon crowds passing
under the arches. (Crowds there must always have been,
in the heyday of the baths, motley, colorful crowds, speaking
many tongues; there is easily room for 2500 patrons
at a time. We may imagine them bathing, sauntering,
making assignations; conversing idly or upon philosophical
subjects; thronging the lecture rooms, the library, the picture-gallery;
running, jumping, racing, ball-playing, or watching
spectator-sports in the stadium at the back.)</p>

<p>The station plan (<a href="#ip_12_6">Fig. 12.6</a>) shows how creatively McKim
imitated Roman architecture. The succession of portico,
vestibule, arcade, vestibule, staircase, which leads to what
before remodelling of 1958 was the climax in the great
central concourse, is noble architectural language, beautiful
ordering of space, which Hadrian would have understood,
and so is the balance in the façade, the alternating rhythms
throughout the building of open and closed, big and little,
wide and narrow. In the arcade, the repeated rhythms
(now spoiled by advertising) emphasize the traditional, and
the movement which is the essence of transportation. The
great central hall, once a pool of open space, is even larger
(340 × 210 feet, and 100 feet high) than the one that inspired
it in the Baths; it is longer than the nave of St.
Peter’s. In it McKim contrived to preserve simplicity, dignity,
and monumentality in spite of mechanical distractions,
as when he used the protruding tops of ventilator shafts as
pedestals for lamp-standards. The other refinements, too,
are in the Roman manner and material. The rich golden
stone facing of the great room is travertine imported from
Tivoli, here used for the first time in America (and now
badly in need of cleaning). The structural steel and glass
in the concourse leading to the trains may have been inspired
by the girders in the Baths of Caracalla. The statistics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
that record 1140 carloads of pink granite brought from New
England to build the half-mile of exterior walls are in the
Roman tradition, and so is the vast extent of the eight-acre
structure, and the six years it took to build. The efficiency
is Roman, too: access on all four sides, carriage drives twice
as wide as the normal New York street of 1910—when the
building was opened—a traffic-flow plan that separated incoming
and outgoing passengers.</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Station belongs to a vanished era, an era
of princely magnificence, of willingness to spend on purely
aesthetic pleasure. The young architectural fellows of McKim’s
Academy in Rome are impatient with what it stands
for, but perhaps they are letting their understandable and
proper scorn of soulless copying—of which there is far too
much in American monumental architecture—stand in the
way of their appreciation of a building which has worn well,
and earned accolades—especially by contrast with recent
tawdry and misguided additions in plastic—from such emancipated
critics, friendly to modern trends in architecture,
as Talbot Hamlin and Lewis Mumford. In a day of what a
less temperate critic than these has called “the monstrous
repetition of cellular facades cloaked with vitreous indifference”
by “sedulous apes to the latest expressions of technological
baboonery,” it may be salutary to look with understanding
at how successful a modern architect of genius
can be with a Roman model.</p>

<p>Roman baths needed oceans of water. It was supplied by
another triumph of Roman engineering, the system of
aqueducts. The eleventh and last of the ancient aqueducts
was built by the Emperor Alexander Severus in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 226;
the earliest, the Aqua Appia, dates back to the same builder
and the same year—312 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>—as the <i>regina viarum</i>. The
network (<a href="#ip_12_8">Fig. 12.8</a>) supplied Rome with over 250,000,000
gallons of water every twenty-four hours. When New York
was thrice the size of Severan Rome, its aqueducts supplied
only 425,000,000 gallons daily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
We owe our knowledge of Rome’s aqueducts to three
people, one ancient and two modern: Sextus Julius Frontinus,
water commissioner under Trajan, whose book on aqueducts
survives, Dr. Thomas Ashby, former Director of the
British School at Rome, and Miss Esther B. Van Deman of
the American Academy. For over thirty years, before
modernity removed the traces, this devoted pair tramped
the rough country between Tivoli and Rome, plotting the
courses of the major aqueducts. Their definitive work is
well-nigh as monumental as the aqueducts themselves. Together
they explored the mazy course of the aqueduct
channels, above ground and below, along crumbling cliffs
and the edge of deep gorges, over walls, through briers,
across turnip fields, in the cellars of farm-houses and wine-shops.
They climbed and waded; Ashby explored downshafts
“with the aid of several companions and a climber’s
rope,” and when they were through, the courses and the
building history especially of Rome’s four major aqueducts,
the Anio Vetus (272–269 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), the Marcia (144 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>), the
Claudia (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 47), and the Anio Novus (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 52)—all repeatedly
repaired—were better known than they had been
since Frontinus’ day, and fellow archaeologists were in a
position to draw from their detailed pioneer work important
conclusions about Roman hydraulic engineering and about
Roman culture.</p>

<p>Following Frontinus’ indications, Ashby and Miss Van
Deman found the sources of the four great aqueducts at
over 1000 feet above sea level, in springs or lakes in the
upper reaches of the Anio valley, near Subiaco, Mandela,
and Vicovaro. The airline distance of the sources from
Rome varies from twenty-four to twenty-seven miles, but
to follow the contours the aqueducts took a circuitous
course, so that their actual length is from forty-three to
sixty-two miles. Though the modern reader associates Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
aqueducts with the magnificent lines of arches (<a href="#ip_12_9">Fig. 12.9</a>)
stretching across a once-empty Campagna near Rome, the
fact is that well under a third of a Roman aqueduct’s course
was normally carried on arches: the rest was tunnel or side-hill
channel. The reason for this was in part economy, in
part strategic considerations: an aqueduct below ground is
harder for an enemy to find and cut. When the Goths finally
did cut the aqueducts in the sixth century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>, the seven
hills of Rome became, and remained for centuries, unfit
for civilized habitation.</p>

<div id="ip_12_9" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 37.5em;">
  <img src="images/i_099.jpg" width="600" height="422" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap fig">Fig. 12.9</span> Aqueducts near Capannelle, reconstruction (painting).</p>

<p>(Deutsches Museum, Munich)</p></div></div>

<p>The four aqueducts, Ashby and Miss Van Deman found,
followed the course of the Anio fairly closely from their
source to just below Tivoli, where, having lost half their
altitude, they turned south along the shoulder of the hills
to Gallicano. In this stretch, at Ponte Lupo, the Aqua
Marcia crosses a gorge on a bridge that would test the
mettle of the most seasoned archaeologist, for it epitomizes
Roman constructional history in stone and concrete for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
almost nine centuries. After Gallicano the intrepid pair
traced the aqueducts’ course westward, where, by a system
of tunnels, inverted siphons (the Romans knew that water
would rise to its own level), and side-hill channels they
cross the broken gorges of the Campagna to a point south
of Capannelle racetrack, six miles from Rome, whence they
proceed on the famous arches to the Porta Maggiore. From
reservoirs in the city the water was distributed in lead pipes
(one, of Hadrianic date, has walls three inches thick, and
weighs eighty-eight pounds per running foot), with a strict
priority, first to public basins and fountains (the Aqua Julia
alone supplied 1200 of these), next to baths (extensions of
the Marcia supplied those of both Caracalla and Diocletian),
then to private houses. Surplus was used for flushing the
sewers. Attempts were made to control the priorities by
running the pipes for private use only from the highest
levels of the reservoirs, but Frontinus complains bitterly of
illegal tapping.</p>

<p>In the Gallicano-Capannelle stretch special archaeological
ingenuity is required, first to find the channels, and then to
decide which belongs to which aqueduct. Where the channels
have entirely disappeared, through the disintegrating
action of floods, earthquake, tree roots, or plowing, the
course can be defined by plotting the occurrence of heaps
of calcium carbonate on the ground. This is the aqueduct
deposit. Roman water is extremely hard, and the heaps
mark where once there were downshafts (<i>putei</i>) for inspection
and cleaning the channels, which without such maintenance
would soon have become completely blocked with
deposit. Frontinus says the downshafts occurred regularly
every 240 feet, and Dr. Ashby found many at just this
interval.</p>

<p>For distinguishing one aqueduct from another there are
many criteria. The first is construction materials. The earliest
aqueducts are built of cut stone, the latest of brick. Miss
Van Deman was famous for her precise dating of building<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
materials; she was the only archaeologist in Rome who could
date a brick by the <i>taste</i> of the mortar. A second criterion
is quality of workmanship. The Claudia, for example, is
notoriously jerry-built: where abutments are found which
should be solid, but are instead one block thick, filled in
with earth behind, that channel belongs to the Aqua Claudia.
A third criterion is mineral deposits. Thus the Marcia was
famous for its purity; the crystalline lime deposits were
quarried in the Middle Ages, polished, and used to decorate
altars. The Anio Novus, on the other hand, is distinguished
by a singularly foul deposit. A fourth criterion is directness
of course: the older the aqueduct the more sinuously it runs;
a channel found meandering by itself along the contours
is likely to be that of the Anio Vetus.</p>

<p>The total impression the aqueducts give is one of efficiency,
organization, and heedlessness of expense, under
the Republic as well as under the Empire. They were built
with the spoils of wars or the tribute of provinces. The
Marcia, built with the proceeds of the loot of Carthage and
Corinth, cost 180,000,000 sesterces, or $9,000,000 uninflated.
The Tepula, of 125 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, was perhaps built with the profits
from the organization of the new province of Asia. From
Agrippa’s time onward, and especially in Frontinus’ administration,
the aqueduct service employed a large bureaucracy;
overseers, reservoir-superintendents, inspectors, stonemasons,
plasterers (the stone-built channels were lined with
two or three coats of hydraulic cement), and unskilled
laborers. Maintenance was a constant problem. Arches
needed propping, filling in, or brick facing; piers needed
to be buttressed or brick-encased. There was no attempt
to produce high pressure: lead pipes would not have stood
it, and for public use it was not necessary. There was no
attempt to make the aqueducts financially self-supporting:
their original building was one of the benefactions expected
of successful commanders. Since these nabobs expected a
<i>quid pro quo</i> in the gift of power, the aqueducts are a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
symbol, under the Republic of irresponsible oligarchy, and
under the Empire of increasingly irresponsible autocracy,
though “good” Emperors like Augustus, Claudius, Trajan,
and Hadrian had a hand in them. In Augustus’ reign were
built the Julia, the Virgo, and the Alsietina. Trajan built
a northern line from Lago di Bracciano to Rome’s Trastevere
quarter on the right bank of the Tiber: part of its
course runs under the courtyard of the American Academy.
Hadrian executed major repairs, datable by the omnipresent
brick stamps. But even good Emperors knew no way of
financing such public works except bleeding the taxpayer.
In municipalities, private capital was absorbed in such
public enterprise, with no return in income or local employment
commensurate with the capital involved. So one
major conclusion from Ashby’s and Miss Van Deman’s work
is that the Romans were better engineers than they were
economists. Let the last word on aqueducts be Pliny the
Elder’s: “If one takes careful account of the abundant supply
of water for public purposes, for baths, pools, channels,
houses, gardens, suburban villas; the length of the aqueducts’
courses—arches reared, mountains tunnelled, valleys
crossed on the level—he will confess that there has never
been a greater marvel in the whole world.”</p>

<p>One of the latest pieces of Roman engineering, to a
knowledge of which archaeology has recently contributed,
is Aurelian’s Wall. It has been meticulously studied by a
pupil of Ashby’s, I. A. Richmond, now Professor of Archaeology
of the Roman Empire at Oxford. Two-thirds of it is
still standing (<a href="#ip_12_10">Fig. 12.10</a>), to the disgust of those interested
in the unimpeded flow of Rome’s traffic, to the delight of
those in love with Rome’s past. It was twelve miles long,
twelve feet thick, sixty feet high; it had 381 towers, each
with a latrine, and eighteen portcullised gates, nine of which
survive (<a href="#ip_12_11">Fig. 12.11</a>). Though the Renaissance humanist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Poggio Bracciolini had examined the wall as early as 1431,
and the Frenchman Nicholas Audebert had studied it
scientifically in 1574, Richmond was still able to make important
contributions. He emphasizes, for example, that one-sixth
of the wall incorporated buildings: tombs, houses,
park walls, aqueducts, cisterns, porticoes, an amphitheater,
a fortress. The inference is that the wall had to be built
with speed and economy, in the face of the threat of barbarians
in north Italy and a depleted treasury. Strategic
reasons, of course, dictated the protection of the aqueducts.
The use of tombstones as latrine covers shows, says Richmond,
that the wall builders “had their religious scruples
under excellent control.” It was a sense of urgency and not
solicitude for works of art that prompted them, when they
built a garden wall at Porta San Lorenzo into the circuit,
to leave the statues in their niches and pack them round
with clay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
Richmond also found that in the phase of the wall identified
as Aurelian’s by building materials and brick stamps,
the workmanship differed sharply from one curtain to another.
The inference from this was that various stretches
were assigned to various gangs of workmen—mostly civilian,
since the legions were needed in the North, and for Aurelian’s
campaign against the Parthians in the East. These
workmen belonged to the various city guilds, or <i>collegia</i>,
some experienced in construction, some not, but all pressed
into service in the emergency.</p>

<p>Richmond distinguished the bottom twenty-four feet of
the wall as the original phase. It was built of brick-faced
concrete—that its bricks were often second-hand is inferred
from the many Hadrianic stamps—surmounted by a gallery
with loopholes outside and an open, bayed arcade inside,
with a crenellated wall-walk above. Access to the wall was
by the towers only; Richmond inferred that the planner
aimed to keep excited and irresponsible civilians from interfering
with defense, and the wall-detail from pilfering
or philandering in the adjoining houses and gardens. In this
phase the wall was plain, efficient, functional, simple, and
uniform, built to a standard size and pattern. Its many gates
show that there was no very formidable danger: the intent
was to provide a barrier to shut chance bodies of undesirables
out of the city as on far-flung frontiers structures like
Hadrian’s Wall shut them out of the Empire.</p>

<p>In its second phase another thirty-six feet of wall was
fitted on to the base provided by Aurelian’s. In some places
the addition was only six feet thick, the other half of the
original width being left as a passage for the circulation of
materials and messages. A wall sixty feet high reduced the
required number of defenders, since it had nothing to fear
from an enemy equipped with scaling ladders. In this phase
machines did the work of men: if there were two <i>ballistae</i>
to a tower, the expensive and impressive total of pieces of
artillery would have been 762. Heightening the wall meant
heightening the tower, sometimes to five stories. A start was
made toward monumentalizing the gateways, but it petered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
out, though the effect can be admired in the Porta Asinaria
near the Lateran, which was restored in 1957–58. For the
workmanship of this phase is identical with and therefore
of the same date as the Basilica and Circus of Maxentius
(who reigned <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 306–312); when he was defeated by Constantine
at the battle of the Milvian Bridge, and the capital
moved to Constantinople, neither the money nor the motive
for monumentality any longer existed.</p>

<p>The next major alteration is dated by inscriptions to <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>
401–403, the reign of Honorius. It was prompted by the
threat that the city might be sacked by Alaric the Visigoth.
It involved second-hand stone facing for the curtains of the
wall, and square bases for the towers. The photograph
(<a href="#ip_12_10">Fig. 12.10</a>) shows this Honorian phase at the Porta Appia.
The upper stories of the round towers belong to Maxentius’
addition, while halfway up the face of the curtain between
the rectangular towers to the left of the gate can be seen
the patching required to add Maxentius’ brickwork to the
battlements of Aurelian’s original wall. (To distinguish the
building phases of the Porta Appia, Richmond had to crawl
into the base of a tower through a very small hole, while
a small uninvited audience bet on his chances of sticking.)
The new battlements were built in a way that shows that
in this phase Rome could no longer afford artillery: archers
replaced <i>ballistae</i>. By now the Empire is Christian, and
crosses begin to appear on the keystones of the gate arches,
as prophylaxis against the devil. Later, in what Richmond
describes as “an age of vanishing standards of faith and
hygiene,” an indulgence of 100 days was granted for kissing
one of these crosses. They were no help: the wall was
assaulted by earthquakes (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 442), and by Goths (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>
536 and 546), and repeatedly repaired. Belisarius in 547
restored it all, with the help of palisades, in twenty days,
and equipped it with spring-guns the force of whose projectiles
could impale five men, and with mantraps or deadfalls,
barrow-like devices which could be pushed over on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
assailants. But the repairs are botched work, appropriate
to what Rome had become: no longer an Imperial capital,
but a minor metropolis of an outlying Byzantine province.
All the same, the wall was never really breached till the
advent of heavy artillery, when Garibaldi’s men attacked
the Porta San Pancrazio in 1849.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>What Richmond’s work has done is to epitomize, in the
history of a work of Roman engineering, Rome’s decline and
fall. This is the latest point in ancient history to which our
survey will take us. In the 1300 years since the Palatine huts
we have, with archaeology’s help, traced Rome’s rise to
grandeur and her agonizing decline. Spiritually, Rome never
fell. The Papacy in a sense is the ghost of the Roman Empire
sitting crowned upon its grave: the symbol is the Popes’
palace-fortress installed in Hadrian’s mausoleum, or St.
Peter’s basilica overlying what is in part a pagan cemetery.
It will be appropriate in the final chapter to confront
Caesar with Christ, by describing a late Imperial hunting
lodge in Sicily, and a tomb beneath the high altar of St.
Peter’s, which by the fourth century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> was believed to be
the last resting place of the apostle who was a fisher of men.</p>

<p>In the official Italian archaeological journal <i>Notizie degli
Scavi</i> for 1951 were reported recent excavations of a grandiose
villa near Piazza Armerina, in central Sicily, which had
already received some notoriety in the press, for depicting
“Bikini girls” in very brief bathing suits (<a href="#ip_13_1">Fig. 13.1</a>). Of
this villa traces had always existed above ground, and as
early as 1754 the discovery had been reported there of a
“temple” (probably the basilica numbered 30 in the plan,
<a href="#ip_13_2">Fig. 13.2</a>), with a mosaic floor. In 1881 the trilobate complex
(46) was excavated, and in 1929 the great Sicilian archaeologist
Paolo Orsi, the expert on prehistoric remains on the
island, dug there. Major funds—500,000 lire—made possible
large-scale excavation between 1937 and 1943, as a part
of <i>Il Duce’s</i> plans for a major celebration of the bimillennary
of Augustus’ birth. After the war, government support
to the tune of 5,000,000 lire (which inflation reduced in
value to $8,000, only a tenth as much as the earlier grant)
made it possible to finish excavating the villa and to take
steps to preserve <i>in situ</i> the mosaics which are its chief
glory. This is one of the few excavations on Italian soil
whose chief avowed intent was to encourage tourism, and
it has succeeded. Piazza Armerina is a boom town, boasting
a new hotel, and its narrow streets are choked with sightseeing
busses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
Both the mosaics and the villa’s ambitious plan make it
a sight worth seeing. There are forty-two polychrome pavements,
involving the setting by the ancient workmen of
30,000,000 individual mosaic rectangles, or <i>tesserae</i>, over an
area of more than 3500 square yards, a complex unique in
extent in the Roman world. The plan, too, is one of the
most ambitious known to archaeology, rivalling that of
Nero’s Golden House, Hadrian’s villa, or Diocletian’s palace
at Spalato on the Dalmatian cost. The villa lies three-and-a-half
miles southwest of Piazza Armerina, nearly 2,000 feet
above sea level, on the west slope of Monte Mangone, in
the midst of green orchards and pleasant groves of nut trees.
Its altitude assured its being cool in summer; its setting
under the lee of the hill protected it from winter winds.
But the slope required terracing, and so the villa was laid
out on four levels centering on three peristyles and a portico
(plan 2,15,41,26). The parts are connected by irregular
rooms (13,14,40). The technique of the masonry shows that
the whole complex is of one build, characterized by asymmetrical
symmetry, strange, twisted ground-plans, a fondness
for curves, and off-center axes, all of which shows a
definite break with conventional classicism. The structure
is light and elastic: the dome over the three-lobed state
dining room (46), nowadays replaced by an unnecessarily
ugly modern roof to protect the mosaics, was built of pumice
concrete, lightened still further by setting in it lengths of
clay pipe and amphorae, to reduce the weight of the superstructure
on the bearing walls.</p>

<p>From a strange polygonal porticoed atrium (2) steps
lead down to a porticoed horseshoe-shaped latrine (6) and
to the baths (7–12), where spatial architecture runs riot,
with single and double apses, a clover-leaf, and an octagonal
<i>frigidarium</i> or room for taking a cold plunge (9). The
middle terrace, east of the baths, centers on a huge trap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331<br /><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>ezoidal
peristyle (15), with a complex fountain, embellished
by a fish mosaic, in the middle, and living rooms opening
off to north and south. South of the peristyle a higher
terrace is occupied by an odd elliptical court, shaped like
a flattened egg, with a buttressed apse at the west end, the
trilobate dining room at the east, and a triple set of conventional
rectangular rooms, with mosaics of Cupids vintaging
and fishing, to the north and south. The total effect is
of an agreeable contrast between straight and curved walls.
Returning to the rectangular peristyle, we find to the east
of it a long double-apsed corridor, like the <i>narthex</i>, or long
narrow portico, in front of an early Christian church. East
of this is a suite of rooms centering on the vast, off-centered,
apsed basilica—larger than Domitian’s on the Palatine in
Rome—which was the earliest part of the villa excavated.
On either side of this is a series of rectangular and apsed
rooms, the private quarters and nursery, to judge by the
mosaics. An aqueduct limits the villa on the north and
east. The servants’ quarters are not yet excavated; they
probably lay to the southwest, to the left of the monumental
entrance (1). The whole is complicated, consistent, functional,
organic, clearly the work of a master architect who
will challenge comparison with the builder of the Sanctuary
of Fortune at Praeneste or with Hadrian himself.</p>

<p>The mosaics must have been done in a hurry by huge
gangs of craftsmen, probably imported from North Africa,
since the technique resembles that of mosaics at Volubilis,
Hippo, Carthage, and Lepcis. Mosaic-making is slow work;
nowadays it takes a careful workman six days to lay a
square meter of tesserae. To finish the job in the space of
a few years must have required a swarm of as many as
500 artisans.</p>

<p>Apart from their vast extent and their subject-matter—of
which more in the sequel—the mosaics are of prime importance
for the contribution they make to dating the villa.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
About its date there is controversy. Professor Biagio Pace
(who excavated here in the ’30’s), relying on stylistic similarities
to late (fifth century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>) mosaics in Ravenna and
Constantinople, would date the villa in about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 410, and
ascribe its ownership to a rich Sicilian landed proprietor.
Pace’s pupil G. V. Gentili, who was in charge of the 1950
excavations, argues, following the Norwegian archaeologist
H. P. L’Orange, for an earlier date. One piece of evidence
not adduced by him is conclusive in his favor. The double-apsed
entrance (8) to the baths contains a spirited mosaic
depicting the Circus Maximus in Rome, full of life and
movement, with the chariots of the four stables, the Greens,
Blues, Whites, and Reds, all represented. The Green—the
Emperor’s favorite—wins, not without a collision. Down the
center of the oval track runs the <i>spina</i>, or division-wall,
surmounted by various monuments, including a single
obelisk in the center (<a href="#ip_13_3">Fig. 13.3</a>). Now it is known that
Augustus set up an obelisk in the Circus Maximus, and
that in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 357 Constantius added another: therefore any
representation of the Circus with only one obelisk must be
earlier than 357. Pace’s late date is therefore excluded.</p>

<p>Is there any possibility of still more precise dating?
Gentili thinks there is. Beginning from the <i>a priori</i> proposition
that a complex architecturally and artistically as grand
as this must be beyond the means of any private citizen,
however rich, he assumes that the villa must have been
built to the order of an Emperor. Which one? To answer
this question he looked among the mosaics for possible
portraits, and he found them in several places. For example,
in the vestibule (13) between the baths and the trapezoidal
peristyle (15) there is an obvious portrait study of the
mistress of the villa flanked by two children, presumably her
son and daughter. The son has a squint. He is represented
again, with the same squint, in the northeast apse of the
<i>frigidarium</i> (9), in the room of the small hunting scene
(23), and in the vestibule of Cupid and Pan (35). (The
effect of the squint is achieved by setting one eye with a
square tessera, the other with a triangular one.)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
Now was the time to have recourse to the study, there
to take down from the shelves the works of the Byzantine
chronicler John Malalas. He records that Maxentius, the
son of the Emperor Maximian Herculius (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 286–305),
Diocletian’s colleague, was cross-eyed. Armed with this
firm clue, Gentili examined the mosaics again, looking for
proof or disproof that the villa belonged to Maximian. He
found proof. Knowing that Maximian Herculius equated
himself with Hercules, as his name shows, he looked for,
and found, evidence in a colossal sculptured head of Hercules
from the basilica apse, and in the mosaic, of preoccupation
with that hero and his exploits. Over and over
again, in the borders of robes, in foliage, and self-standing
(in 4) he found representations of ivy, which was Hercules’
symbol: the initial of its Latin name, <i>hedera</i>, is the initial
of the hero’s name. Furthermore, one of the most extensive
and important mosaics in the villa, that in the state dining
room (46), has as its subject the labors of Hercules. Gentili’s
case looks conclusively proven; it was buttressed when he
took up the Circus mosaic (8), to back it with concrete and
replace it, and found under it a hypocaust containing coins
of the late third century, presumably dropped by the workmen
who laid the mosaic in the first place.</p>

<p>The subjects of the mosaics are in part more or less conventional
mythological scenes. Odysseus hoodwinks the
one-eyed Sicilian giant Polyphemus, making him drunk with
a great bowl of wine (27); an obliging dolphin rescues
the musician Arion from a watery grave (32), and Orpheus
with his lyre charms a vast array of animals, including a
goldfinch, a lizard, and a snail (39). Still more interesting
are the mosaics which show Maximian’s interests. He appears
to have had three obsessions: hunting, the circus, and
his children. The three scenes of the chase (23,26,33) have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
prompted L’Orange to suggest that the villa was built as a
sumptuous hunting-lodge, but the great basilica shows that
it was adapted also to the uses of more formal protocol;
the Imperial court must sometimes have met here.</p>

<p>The smaller hunting scene (23) is divided into five bands
(<a href="#ip_13_4">Fig. 13.4</a>). At the top, two eager hounds, one gray, one
red, are off in full cry after a fox. Next below, a young
hunter identified by Gentili as Constantius Chlorus, Maximian’s
adopted son, accompanied by our old friend the
squint-eyed Maxentius, sacrifices to Diana, the goddess of
the hunt. The third band is devoted to fowling—with birdlime—and
falconry, the fourth to the fox, gone to ground
and besieged in his den by the dogs. In the fifth, on the
left a stag is about to be caught in a net stretched across a
forest path in the unsporting Roman way; on the right is
a boar-hunt with an unorthodox hunter just about to make
the kill by dropping a large rock from above on the boar’s
head. In the center is a vivid huntsman’s picnic. The
hunters, wearing puttees, are sitting under a red awning.
While they are waiting, one of them feeds the dog. A black
boy blows on the fire, over which a succulent-looking
trussed bird is roasting. Servants fetch bread from a wicker
basket; another basket harbors two ample amphorae of
wine.</p>

<p>This is an intimate <i>genre</i> scene. More impressive is the
large hunting scene which crowds the whole 190-foot length
of the double-apsed corridor (26). Here the aim portrayed
is to catch exotic North African animals alive for the wild
beast hunts in amphitheaters like the Coliseum. In the south
apse is a female figure symbolizing Africa, flanked by a
tiger and an amiable small elephant with a reticulated hide.
The figure in the opposite apse who has a bear on one side,
a panther on the other may be Rome, the animals symbolizing
her dominion over palm and pine. In this case
Africa is the point of departure of the captured beasts,
Rome their destination. Between the two apses the hunting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
scenes unfold amid fantastic architecture in a rolling,
wooded landscape sloping down to the sea in the center,
teeming with fish. On land, animals attack each other (a
leopard draws blood from a stag’s belly), and hunters in
rich embroidered tunics hurl javelins, in the presence of the
Emperor, at snarling lions and tigers at bay, set traps baited
with kid for panthers (the kid being spread-eagled in a way
that looks curiously like a parody of the Crucifixion). The
hunters act as bearers—their heads camouflaged with leafy
twigs, like Birnam wood coming to Dunsinane—or drag a
lassoed bison toward the red ship that will transport it to
Italy. A horseman, having stolen a tiger cub, delays the
mother’s advance by dropping another cub in her path.
A hippopotamus and a rhinoceros are among the game;
smaller animals are hauled to the ships in crates on ox-carts;
a live trussed boar is carried slung on a pole; a recalcitrant
ostrich and an antelope are being pushed up a gangway
(<a href="#ip_13_5">Fig. 13.5</a>), while the gangway of another ship is groaning
under the weight of an elephant with a checkerboard hide
like the one flanking Africa in the apse. Most curious of all,
just in front of this same apse the tables are turned: a man
has taken refuge in a cage against the attack of a fabulous
winged griffin, with the head of a bird of prey. The crowded,
vivid, barbarous artistry of this mosaic brings us to the very
threshold of the Byzantine age; in Rome’s past, only the
Barberini mosaic at Palestrina can match it.</p>

<p>In Maximian’s family even the children were brought up
to take part in blood sports. Room 36, a child’s room, perhaps
Maxentius’—his squint-eyed portrait recurs in the
anteroom (35)—portrays a child’s hunt, in three bands, full
of characteristic Roman insensibility to animal suffering. In
the upper band, a boy has hit a spotted hare full in the
breast with a hunting spear, while another has lassoed a
duckling. The middle band portrays hunting mishaps: a
small animal nips one fallen small boy in the leg; a cock
attacks another with its beak and spurs. In the bottom register<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
one boy clubs a peacock, a second defends himself
with a shield against a buzzard, and a third has plunged
his hunting spear into the heart of a goat.</p>

(Pace, <i>Mosaici</i>, Pl. 7)</div></div>

<p>The child’s Circus (33), unlike the hunt, is rather fantastic
than brutal. Around a <i>spina</i> with a single obelisk, as
in room 8, run four miniature chariots drawn by pairs of
birds in the appropriate stable colors: green wood-pigeons,
blue plovers, red flamingoes, and white geese. As usual,
Green wins, and is awarded the palm. Servants with amphorae
sprinkle the track to lay the dust. It is all vivid,
detailed, alive, more illuminating than a dozen pages in a
handbook.</p>

<p>The masterpiece among the mosaics is clearly the labors
of Hercules cycle in the <i>triclinium</i> (46). These were part
of a standard repertory, available for copying from a book
of cartoons (we have seen this sort of thing in Pompeii),
but here the artist has stamped his own personality on the
hackneyed scenes. In his hands they are at once learnedly
allusive and bloodily violent. Thus the Augean stables,
which Hercules cleaned by diverting a river to run through
them, are simply suggested by a river and a pitchfork.
Violence is often rather hinted at than insisted on, as in
the slit-like eye of the dying Nemean lion, or the Picasso-like
protruding eye of the terrified horse of Diomedes
(<a href="#ip_13_6">Fig. 13.6</a>). Sometimes the effect is gained by a topical
touch, as when Geryon, the triple-headed giant, is given
a suit of scaly armor, like the barbarians (cataphractarii)
on Trajan’s column. But the full baroque excess, as insistent
as in the frieze from the Pergamene altar, or the Laocoön
group, comes out in the scene in the east lobe where five
huge giants, foreshortened with a technique which anticipates
Michelangelo’s on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel,
convulsively, despairingly, imploringly, yet full of impotent
rage, turn their deep-sunk eyes to heaven as they strive to
pull from their flesh Hercules’ deadly arrows, steeped in the
blood of the Centaur Nessus. In the north lobe the apotheosis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
of Hercules is no doubt the mosaicist’s enforced tribute
to his Imperial master, but in the scenes of metamorphosis
in the entrance-ways to the apses—Daphne into a laurel,
Cyparissus into a cypress, Ambrosia into a vine—he is following
his own paradoxical bent, accepting as it were the
challenge of expressing so dynamic a thing as the change
from one form to another in the obdurate medium of mosaic.</p>

<p>The ten “Bikini Girls” (38) come last, because these
mosaics, which overlie another set, are obviously later than
the rest. They owe their fame to the scantiness of their
costumes, as brief as any to be seen on modern European
beaches. Gentili thinks they are female athletes, being
awarded prizes, but Pace may be nearer the truth in supposing
that they are pantomime actresses, with tambourines
and <i>maracas</i>, performing in a sort of aquacade, the blue
<i>tesserae</i> in which they stand representing water. There is
ancient evidence for this curiously decadent art-form. Martial
speaks of actresses dressed—or undressed—as Nereids
swimming about in the Coliseum, and the Church fathers
fulminate against such spectacles. When the orchestra of
the most august of theaters, that of Dionysus in Athens, was
remodelled in Roman times to hold water, we must suppose,
since the space is too small for mock naval battles, that
the place once sacred to the choruses of Aeschylus, Sophocles,
and Euripides was thereafter used for the aquatic
antics of just such actresses as the Piazza Armerina mosaics
portray. Tastelessness and grandeur, conspicuous waste and
a daring architectural plan: this paradoxical blend, so
characteristic of the villa, explains both what is meant by
decline and why it took the Empire so long to fall.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>The villa at Piazza Armerina belongs to an age when
Christians were persecuted: the motifs in the mosaics are
almost aggressively pagan. But Maximian’s son-in-law Constantine
became in the end a convert to Christianity, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
built, beginning about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 322, in honor of St. Peter, a
great basilica church on the Vatican Hill, replaced in the
Renaissance by the present building. In 1939, at the death
of Pope Pius XI, who had asked to be buried in the crypt
of St. Peter’s, excavations for his tomb created the occasion
for transforming the crypt into a lower church. In lowering
the floor level of the crypt for this purpose, the workmen
came, only eight inches down, upon the pavement of Old
St. Peter’s, Constantine’s church. This in turn rested upon
mausolea with their tops sliced off, and their interiors rammed
full of earth. At the direction of Pius XII, these
mausolea were scientifically excavated.</p>

<p>What was revealed was a pagan Roman cemetery, in some
places thirty feet below the floor of the present church. The
mausolea were all in use and in good repair when Constantine
began his church in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 322: the earliest brick stamp
found in the area dates from the reign of Vespasian, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>
69–79. The excavations were carried out under conditions
comparable in difficulty only to the recovery of the Altar
of Peace: the same constant battle with seepage, the same
problem of underpinning one structure in order to read the
message of another. Under these formidable difficulties, the
cemetery was cleared, and archaeologists found the reason
why Constantine moved a million cubic feet of earth and
went so far as to violate sepulchres to build Old St. Peter’s
on just this site. Whatever modern walls it was necessary to
build were carefully marked with Pius XII brick-stamps,
that future archaeologists might be in no doubt as to which
masonry was modern and which ancient. The cemetery may
now be visited by small groups with special permission,
under the expert guidance of a polyglot archaeologist. The
story he has to tell was not published until over ten years
after the excavation began, in a massive two-volume <i>Report</i>
which stands fifteen and three-quarters inches high, contains
171 text figures and 119 plates, and weighs fourteen
pounds. Fortunately its objectivity is as impressive as its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
bulk. The archaeological evidence is lucidly set forth, and
no conclusions are drawn which exceed it.</p>

<p>We know from Tacitus that Nero, in his search for scapegoats
on whom to shift the blame for Rome’s great fire of
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 64, martyred Christians in an amphitheater on the Vatican
Hill, and tradition has it that in this amphitheater St.
Peter, too, suffered martyrdom. It was to test the validity
of this tradition that Pius XII ordered the cemetery under
St. Peter’s excavated. What was found was a series of twenty-one
mausolea and one open area (P in the plan, <a href="#ip_13_7">Fig. 13.7</a>),
all facing southward onto a Roman street. The mausolea
are plain brick on the outside, highly baroque within, enriched
with mosaics, wall-paintings, and stucco-work. There
are both cremation and inhumation burials, but when the
mausolea were filled in inhumation was beginning to predominate.
Of the mausolea only M is entirely Christian in
décor; others began as pagan, later admitting Christian
burials, or adapt pagan motifs to Christian symbolism. M
contains the earliest known Christian mosaics, which Ward
Perkins and Miss Toynbee call a microcosm of the dramatic
history of Christianity’s peaceful penetration of the pagan
Roman Empire. They are dated by technique and motifs
to the middle of the third century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> The subjects are
Jonah and the whale, the Fisher of Men, the Good Shepherd,
and, in the vault, Christ figured as the sun. The wall
paintings of the cemetery are mostly pagan, the contractors’
stock-in-trade, depicting in myth or in symbol the soul’s
victory over death. The great artistic interest of the mausolea
is in the stucco-work, both in relief and in the round,
superior in quality to that of the subterranean basilica at
the Porta Maggiore. Some of it is of unparalleled scale and
complexity, excellently preserved (<a href="#ip_13_8">Fig. 13.8</a>), and now protected
from dampness by large, constantly burning electric
heaters. Of stone sculpture in the round there is very little;
it was probably removed by Constantine’s workmen. But
there are many marble sarcophagi with pagan and Christian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
motifs, testifying to the artistic revival enjoyed by the Roman
world with the peace of the Church in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 312. They
show how the stonemasons carved them as blanks, filling
in details like inscriptions and portrait busts to the customer’s
order. There is a pathetic one of a baby, who died,
the inscription tells us, when he was six months old. There
are reliefs of Biblical scenes: the children in the fiery furnace,
Joseph and his brethren, the three Magi, and what
may be the earliest Christian cross, dated about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 340;
(an alleged cross at Herculaneum is more probably the
scar of a ripped-away wall bracket).</p>

<p>The cemetery tells us something about the status and
the religious convictions of its owners and occupants. Of
the persons recorded in its inscriptions, over half have Greek
names. They are freedmen or descendants of freedmen,
many in the Imperial civil service. Some are tradesmen,
some artisans. Only one was of Senatorial rank: his daughter’s
body was wrapped in purple and veiled in gold. The
richness of the tombs bespeaks an attitude that is modern
enough, or rather neither ancient nor modern, but a constant.
Paradoxically, importance is attached to material
things, to the race for riches and creature comforts, while
at the same time there is a preoccupation with the after
life, a return, after the skepticism of the earlier Empire, to
a belief in a personal immortality in store for those who
have led moral lives. The deceased are connected with the
world they have left behind by tubes for libations, that
wine and milk may be poured down on their bones. Heaven
is variously conceived: as a place of blessed sleep, or, like
the Etruscan heaven, a succession of banquets, wine, and
gardens. Grief is swallowed up in victory; the dead have
their patron heroes: Hermes, Hercules, Minerva, Apollo,
Dionysus, the Egyptian Isis or Horus—and Christ.</p>

<p>But the pagan cemetery, interesting as it is for the light
it casts on the middle class of the early fourth century of
our era, is not the centrally important archaeological discovery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
under St. Peter’s, nor does it supply the motive for
Constantine’s location of his church just here. That motive
the excavators found in the open space they named “Campo
P.” Campo P is separated from mausoleum R by a sloping
passage, called the Clivus; the drain under the passage
contains tiles with stamps dated between the years 147–161,
which fall within the reign of Antoninus Pius. A painted
brick wall, since made famous as the Red Wall, separates
the Clivus from Campo P. Into this wall are cut three superposed
niches, two in the fabric of the wall itself, one beneath
its foundations, which were actually raised on a sort of
bridge at this point to protect the cavity. In front of the
niches traces were found of a modest architectural façade,
called the Aedicula, or little shrine.</p>

<p>In the cavity the excavators found human bones, which
they have never identified further than to describe them
as those of a person of advanced age and robust physique.
The Aedicula penetrated above the pavement of Old St.
Peter’s and formed its architectural focus. The conclusion
is inevitable that Constantine in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 322 planned his basilica
to rise just here, at great trouble and expense, because he
believed the lowest niche, under the Red Wall, to enshrine
a relic of overarching importance, nothing less than the
bones of St. Peter. There is thus no doubt whatever, on
objective evidence, that the Aedicula was reverenced in
the fourth Christian century as marking the burial place of
the founder of the Roman church.</p>

<p>(Toynbee and Ward Perkins, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 141)</p></div></div>

<p>But this is not the end of the problem. The next question
is, “How early can the burial, by objective archaeological
evidence, be demonstrated to be?” The answer to this question
must be sought, if anywhere, in the context of Campo
P. This proved on excavation to be an area of poor graves,
marked, like those of the necropolis of the Port of Ostia
on Isola Sacra, simply by a surround and a pitched roof of
tiles, without any of the pomp of costly marble sarcophagus
or richly stuccoed mausoleum. It is to the class which would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
be buried in such pathetic graves as these that the earliest
Roman Christians (of the age of Nero [<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 64]) must have
belonged. (Since the <i>Report</i> was published, Professor Magi,
whom we have already met in connection with the Cancelleria
reliefs, has discovered, under the Vatican City parking
lot, another cemetery, also of poor graves, of the first century
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>; there is no cogent proof that they are Christian.) The
graves in Campo P (<a href="#ip_13_9">Fig. 13.9</a>) were found to lie at various
levels: the deepest must be the earliest. The deepest is the
one called by the excavators Gamma (see plan, γ, <a href="#ip_13_9">Fig. 13.9</a>):
it lies five-and-a-half feet below the pavement of Campo P,
and it partly underlies, and is therefore older than, the
foundations of the Red Wall, which in turn is dated by the
Clivus drain about the middle of the second century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span>
Grave Theta (θ) is higher, and therefore later, than Gamma.
It is a poor grave, protected by tiles, one of which bears a
stamp of Vespasian’s reign (<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 69–79). It is unsafe method
to date an archaeological find by a single brick stamp which
could be second-hand, used at any date later than its firing,
even much later. But the stamp creates at least a presumption<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
that Theta may be dated as early as <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 79, and, if
so, Gamma must be earlier still. Since both these graves
appear to have been dug in such a way as to respect the
area just in front of the Aedicula, it follows that the bones
in the lowest niche must be earlier than either grave.</p>

<p>This is the process by which it is possible (but not rigorously
necessary, on the evidence) to date the bones before
<span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 79, perhaps in the reign of Nero; perhaps they are the
bones of a victim of the persecution of <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 64; perhaps
they are the bones of St. Peter. They were evidently disturbed
in antiquity, for this is not a proper burial, but
simply a collection of bones; the head, for example, is missing.
The original burial must have lain athwart the line
of the later Red Wall: when the builders of the Red Wall
hit upon it, they may, knowing the legend of St. Peter’s
martyrdom in the amphitheater somewhere near this spot,
have assumed that this was his grave, and so they arched
up the Red Wall’s foundations to avoid disturbing it. The
next step was to build the Aedicula (<a href="#ip_13_10">Fig. 13.10</a>), an act
associated in literary sources with Pope Anacletus (traditional
dates, <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 76–88), but since not even the most pious
Catholics suppose the Aedicula to be this early, an emendation
of the name into Anicetus (<i>ca.</i> 155–165) is defensible:
it is paleographically plausible, and it suits the date of the
Red Wall. The traces of the Aedicula as found were asymmetrical:
its north supporting column had been moved to
make room for a wall that was built sometime before Constantine
to buttress the Red Wall, which had developed
a bad crack from top to bottom. The excavators found the
north face of this buttress wall covered with a palimpsest
of <i>graffiti</i>, only one of which—in Greek—refers to St. Peter
by name, though some others may do so in a cryptic way,
and all testify that this spot was one of particular sanctity,
much frequented by pilgrims.</p>

by G. U. S. Corbett. (Toynbee and Ward Perkins, <i>op. cit.</i>, p. 161)</p></div></div>

<p>The shrine under St. Peter’s is not the only spot in Rome
associated with St. Peter. Another is under the Church of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
San Sebastiano, two-and-a-half miles out, just off the Appian
Way. Here excavation has found <i>graffiti</i> mentioning St.
Peter and St. Paul, a room for taking ceremonial meals, and
Christian tombs of the third century <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> Some scholars
believe, but without cogent archaeological evidence, that
St. Peter’s body, in whole or in part, was moved to this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
retired spot off the main road, from the Vatican Hill, for
safety during the persecutions under the Emperor Valerian
in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 258. This would explain the association of the San
Sebastiano site with the apostle; the assumption that the
bones were returned to the Aedicula after the danger was
past would explain—though it is not the only possible explanation—the
disturbed state in which the excavators found
them.</p>

<p>In any case, in the years between the building of the
Aedicula and the centering of Constantine’s church upon
it, there was continuity of pious commemoration of the spot.
This is proved by the <i>graffiti</i> on the buttress wall, and by
a series of burials, Alpha, Beta, Delta, Epsilon, and Mu (α, β, δ, ε, μ)
all motivated by a desire to be buried as close
as possible to the Aedicula, and all, to judge by their contents—remains
of cloth in Beta, for example, showed gold
threads—belonging to important people. Some scholars (not
including the excavators) have supposed that these are the
graves of early Popes.</p>

<p>This was the state of affairs in Campo P when the building
of Constantine’s basilica began. The Aedicula was made
the focus of the whole building plan: it was left projecting
above the pavement of the new church, and it was covered
by a canopy upheld by twisted columns. (It is an extraordinary
coincidence that Bernini, when he built the canopy
over the altar of the Renaissance church, chose twisted
columns to uphold it, though he could not possibly have
known that Constantine’s canopy also involved this detail.)
Constantine’s architect, in the classical tradition, paid the
secular Roman basilica the compliment of creative imitation.</p>

<p>It was not until about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 600 that the altar was placed
directly over the shrine, and the presbytery raised to accommodate
it. By that time, the tradition was firmly established
that pious pilgrims should leave a votive coin in
front of the Aedicula: here in the fill the excavators found
1900 coins, Roman, papal, Italian, and from all over Europe,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
ranging in date from before <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 161 uninterruptedly down
to the fourteenth century. Also about <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 600, at the same
time as the placing of the altar directly over the shrine, the
two upper niches in the Red Wall were combined into one,
the Niche of the Pallia, where the vestments of newly-consecrated
archbishops were put to be sanctified by close
contact with the bones of the first Bishop of Rome: a shaft
in the floor of the niche led down to the grave.</p>

<p>The shrine and the Constantinian church survived the
sacks of Rome both by the Goths in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 410, and by the
Vandals in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 455; the Saracens in <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 846 were not so
respectful. In their search for treasure they handled the
Aedicula very roughly, and it is likely that it is from this
sack, and not from the persecution of <span class="smcap smaller">A.D.</span> 258, that the
disturbance of the bones should be dated. In any case, after
the sack the life of the shrine went on as before, and in the
Renaissance church as in its predecessor the shrine remained
the focal point, one of the most venerated spots
in Christendom.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>With the shrine of St. Peter, venerable, still vital, going
back to the two roots of western civilization, pagan Rome
(itself the transmitter of Greek culture) and Christianity,
it is fitting that we should end our survey of what archaeology
has to tell us about the culture to which ours owes so
much. The two complexes, the grandiose pagan villa and
the humble Christian shrine, which we have discussed in
this chapter, are interrelated. The villa is one of the last
manifestations of a culture that is played out, the shrine
marks the beginning of a new culture that will produce its
own grandiose monuments and in its turn be threatened
by decline. In a sense, with the simplicity of St. Peter’s
shrine the historical cycle returns to the simplicity of primitive
Rome. But it is not simply a matter of returning to
beginnings and starting over again; the new culture stands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
upon the shoulders of the old. The Christian shrine has the
look of a pagan tomb-monument in the Isola Sacra necropolis;
Constantine’s church has the look of a pagan Roman
basilica. The language of the Mass is still Latin; the Pope
is Pontifex Maximus. The striking thing is the continuity,
and this is the most important lesson that archaeology has
to teach. Again beneath St. Peter’s, as at so many other
ancient sites, what the archaeologist digs up is not things
but people. The remains in the niche under the Red Wall
are not dry bones; they are live history. The breathing of
life into that history is a major and largely unsung triumph
of the modern science of archaeology, patiently at work
over the last eighty years. To come to know a fragment of
our past is to recognize a piece of ourselves. Perhaps, as
archaeology interprets history, making the mute stones
speak, we may come to know our past so well that we
shall not be condemned to repeat it.</p>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; occasional unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the correction was apparent,
and otherwise left unresolved.</p>

<p>Index not checked for proper alphabetization or correct page references.</p>

<p>Some images have been rotated 90° to make them easier to read.</p>

<p>In the original book, two or three images often
were placed on the same page and sometimes overlapped each
other to save space. In this eBook, they are shown separately,
in Figure-number sequence.</p>

<p>Images have been moved, when necessary, between paragraphs,
so the page numbers in the List of Illustrations do not always
match the actual positions of the images in this eBook.</p>

<p>Images were of various sizes in the original book.  Here, most
are shown at a uniformly-large size, while a few are shown
even larger to make details and text identifications readable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#ip_2_9">Fig. 2.9</a></span> was printed as shown, apparently mirror-image,
perhaps as a rubbed impression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#ip_7_4">Fig. 7.4</a></span> had no caption; the one shown in this eBook
was copied from the List of Illustrations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap"><a href="#ip_8_7">Fig. 8.7</a></span>’s “Legend” was difficult to read and has not

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
